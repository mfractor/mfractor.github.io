MFractor constantly inspects your code and shows suggestions of the most common operations done from the code of code you're writing at that time. Important MFractor Code Inspector works entirely locally and doesn't track any of your code. Using the Code Actions MFractor ships with tons of Code Actions to enhance common .NET and Xamarin development tasks and aids you to avoid writing boilerplate code. They are context sensitive, so it will only be presented in places where it made sense to be applied. Code Actions are available to either C# and XAML code. Info The section below presents general guidance on how to invoke the Code Actions for different types of source files. Check the documentation of the MFractor Code Action you're interested to use to understand the specific contexts where they can be applied. Code Actions for C# Code The C# Code Actions provides refactorings, code generation wizards and utilities to code written in C#. They are context sensitive and there are several ways they can be invoked. From instance, let's take as an example the Generate Interface Implementation Code Action , that allows you to quickly create a new class that implement the interface you're working with. This Code Action appears when you are editing any C# Interface Code File. Leave the cursor over the name of the Interface for half a second. Visual Studio will present a little screwdriver icon to the left of the editor, which indicates to the user that there are Code Actions available related to this part of your code. Click the icon and the suggestions will appear: Tip The suggestions menu presented from the screwdriver icon is called Quick Fix and can be opened with the ALT + Enter keyboard shortcut. This shortcut can also be customized from the Key Bindinds section of Visual Studio Preferences. The Code Actions can also be invoked from the context menu when you right click over a symbol in the code. Given the previous example right click over the same interface name the action will appear under the Generate sub-menu: Code Actions for XAML Code The XAML Code Actions provide refactorings and code generation wizards and utilities to Xamarin.Forms XAML source files. They are context sensitive, but unlike the C# Code Actions, they aren't easily discoverable since the Quick Fix menu isn't available on the current stable of the new XAML Code Editor on Visual Studio for Mac. For this reason, they are only accessible from the context menu. For instance, let's take the Extract XAML Style Code Action , which allows you to extract property declarations on element to style and refactor that element to reference it. If you right-click over an element declaration that contains one or more property declarations, the Extract XAML Style will be available under the Refactor sub-menu: In the example above, the Generate a new View Model for XAML view Code Action would also be available under the Generate sub-menu, because the context also applies for this action.","title":"Code Actions"},{"location":"code-actions/#introduction","text":"Code Actions enhance developer productivity by providing tools that allows you to quickly refactor and generate new code from your existing code.

Introduction The MFractor Documentation site is an open source project created and maintained by MFractor. Our goal is to provide rich documentation and reference to our users and customers so they can get the most of the tool. The docs is not only about the tool features itself, but we always try to bring knowledge on development platforms that MFractor assists. Mission Our readers must learn something new beyond the product feature they're searching information itself and enrich their knowledge of the platforms that our tool assists. Documenting a product is critical and hard to do right and keep up to date. The MFractor team is very small and strive to keep up with the ever changing product features. Community contribution is very desired and welcome to achieve the goal of having this site not only as a source of information for MFractor but also as an important knowledge base for developers. Contribution Workflow Contributing to MFractor Documentation is much like any Git hosted open source project: Pick an issue you wish to contribute and comment on Fork the project repository at GitHub Make your changes to your forked repository Open a Pull Request to merge your changes to the main repo If your changes are accepted we'll merge it and notify you about it. We may ask you for additional changes or reply with suggestions through comments on the Pull Request. In case we add suggestions to your Pull Request we will provide a 3 day time-frame for you to review before merging your changes. We may decide to apply the suggestions internally after the merge. This is the high level diagram of the Contribution Workflow: Important All the work to this repository is tracked through issues. We can't track forks to know about ongoing contributions to the project, so please keep your comments on the issues you may be working on so we can manage conflicts. If you've found a problem or a missing documentation that is not listed on the issues, please open one before starting your work. Info We may change parts of your contribution to fix typos, correct data or add missing information. This will be done without notice. Accepted contributions will be acknowledge on a specific section of the home page. Don't add the acknowledgements to your Pull Requests , otherwise they will be rejected. Citations will be only handled internally by our moderation team. Requirements This documentation is written using mkdocs , a popular platform for software documentation sites, and takes advantage of the mkdocs-material a plugin that adds material design concepts and themes to the site. To contribute you can use the mkdocs-material docker image (preferred) or will need to install a few things: Install Python . Install pip . Depending on your terminal shell, configure PATH to point to pips binary folder: For zsh , create the file ~\\.zshrc with the contents: export PATH=\"$PATH:/Users/matthewrobbins/Library/Python/2.7/bin\" For bash , create the file ~\\.bash_profile with the contents: export PATH=\"$PATH:/Users/matthewrobbins/Library/Python/2.7/bin\" Install mkdocs from the pip tool pip install mkdocs . Install the [Material Theme for mkdocs] from pip install mkdocs-material * Important Make sure to install mkdocs and the material theme both using pip . If you install mkdocs from Homebrew and them install the material theme from pip (the only place where its available as a package) you will get errors trying to compile the docs or running it locally. Local installation is error prone. Consider using the docker image for faster and simpler setup. The script file dsrv at the root of the repository ( docs branch) will try to download the correct image and run the local server. Note The publish.sh and dpub scripts are intended for publishing are only used internally. Trying to use them without the required permissions will fail. Extensions admonition and codehilite are part of the material theme. The tabbed and superfences extensions are part of the PyMdown Extensions that are bundled with material theme. markdown_extensions: - attr_list - admonition - codehilite - pymdownx.tabbed - pymdownx.superfences Troubleshooting If the Material Theme isn't installed when you try to run the project it won't work and you'll get the following error: mkdocs serve INFO - Building documentation...

Introduction MFractor includes a code-analysis engine that inspects your XAML code for a wide range of common issues. Managing Analysers MFractors code analysers can be enabled or disabled at the application-level through the product Preferences . To enable or disable a particular code analyser, first, navigate to the top menu bar, find the MFractor tab and then click Preferences . Scroll down to Code Analysis and you can search for a specific one or toggle to disable at an application level. If you'd like to disable at for only a particular document, please see our Disabling Analysers article. MFractor currently includes 95 analysers. Available Code Analysers Diagnostic ID Name Description MF1000 Duplicate AutomationIds Inspects a Xaml document for occurances of duplicate AutomationId declarations. MF1001 Empty AutomationId Declaration Inspects a Xaml document for occurances of duplicate AutomationId declarations.

MF1003 Duplicate Code Behind Field Declarations Checks that the value assigned to an x:Name attribute is unique within the scope of the document. MF1004 Empty Code Behind Field Declaration Inspects occurances of the x:Name attribute and validates that a value is assigned; empty x:Name expressions generate an empty named code-behind field, causing compilation errors. MF1005 ContentPage Has Multiple Direct Children Inspects usages of ContentPage and checks that it only has a single child view. Assigning multiple children into a ContentPage is a common mistake where the developer usually intended to wrap the chid views with a Grid or a StackLayout . MF1006 ContentView Has Multiple Direct Children Inspects usages of the ContentView element and checks that it only has a single child view. Assigning multiple children into a ContentView is a common mistake where the developer usually intended to wrap the chid views with a Grid or a StackLayout . MF1007 Validate Binding Expressions Return A Property Evaluates a Binding expression and validates that it points to property within the binding context. This analyser requires an explict or implicit binding context. MF1008 Binding Against Non-Public Property Inspects data-binding expressions and validates that the property return is a public property. Data-binding against a non-public property causes data-binding to fail. MF1009 Binding Expressions Resolve Inspects Binding expressions and validates that the symbol referred to in the binding context exists. This analyser requires an explict or implicit binding context. MF1010 Binding Expression Return Type Mismatch Validates that the .NET symbol returned by a binding expression matches the expected type for the property. MF1011 No Key Provided To DynamicResource Expression Inspects DynamicResource expressions and validates that a resource key has been provided. MF1012 Empty Event Handler Assignment Checks that an event handler assignment is not empty as empty event handler assignments will cause a compilation error. MF1013 Event Handler Exists In Code Behind Class Checks that an event callback referenced referenced by an attribute value exists in the code behind class. MF1014 Event Handler Signature Mismatch Checks that the signature for the event callback in a code behind class matches the expected signature for the property it is assigned to. MF1015 Referenced Code Behind Field Exists Inspects usages of the x:Reference expression and validates the referenced element has been declared within the document. x:Reference expressions are used to resolve another Xaml node has a code behind field defined using the x:Name attribute. MF1016 Value Converter Input Type Mismatch Inspects the Converter property of a Binding expression and validates that the input type is correct. This analyser requires that the IValueConverter implementation uses the ValueConversion attribute to declare it input type. MF1017 Value Converter Output Type Mismatch Inspects the Converter component of a Binding expression and validates that the returned output type is valid for the parent attribute. This analyser requires that the IValueConverter implementation uses the ValueConversion attribute to declare it input type. MF1018 Unresolved .NET Symbols Within Xaml Expression Inspects a .net symbol reference (eg local:MyClass.MyProperty ) and validates that the symbol portion ('MyClass.MyProperty') resolves to a .NET symbol within the current project and it's references. MF1019 Unresolved Namespace Within Xaml Expression Inspects a .net symbol reference (eg local:MyClass.MyProperty ) and validates that the namespace portion ('local') resolves to a xmlns declaration in the current document. MF1020 Invalid Named Font Size Inspects FontSize attributes and validates that the named size provided to it is a valid font size name (Micro, Small, Medium, Large). MF1021 Generic Usage Is Missing x:TypeArguments Inspects generic classes that are instantiated through Xaml and validates that an x:TypeArguments attribute or property assignment node is present. MF1022 x:TypeArguments Used On Non-Generic Class Inspects for usages of x:TypeArguments on elements that are non-generic classes. MF1023 Unknown Type Provided To Generic Inspects usages of x:TypeArguments and validates that the type provided exists. MF1024 Column Is Outside Grid Boundaries This code analyser inspects usages of the Grid.Column attribute and validates that the column provided is within the total columns declared by the parent grid. MF1025 ColumnSpan Is Outside Grid Boundaries This code analyser inspects usages of the Grid.ColumnSpan attribute and validates that the span provided is within the total columns declared by the parent grid. MF1026 ColumnSpan Is Zero This code analyser inspects usages of the Grid.ColumnSpan attribute and validates that the span provided is a non-zero value. MF1027 Grid Row/Column Setter Is Not A Number This code analyser inspects usages of the Grid.Column attribute and validates that the element is inside a Grid . MF1028 Grid.Column Usage Is Redundant This code analyser inspects usages of the Grid.Column attribute and validates that the element is inside a Grid . MF1029 Grid.ColumnSpan Usage Is Redundant This code analyser inspects usages of the Grid.ColumnSpan attribute and validates that the element is inside a Grid . MF1030 Grid.Row Usage Is Redundant This code analyser inspects usages of the Grid.Row attribute and validates that the element is inside a Grid .

MF1034 RowSpan Is Zero This code analyser inspects usages of the Grid.RowSpan attribute and validates that the span provided is a non-zero value. MF1035 Detect Missing Image In Linked Projects This code analyser inspects the value provided into an ImageSource and validates that an image of that name exists within any iOS or Android projects that reference this shared project or PCL. MF1036 OnIdiom Return Type Mismatch Checks the type returned by a Xamarin.Forms.OnIdiom element is valid with the parent property type. MF1037 OnPlatform Return Type Mismatch Checks the type returned by a Xamarin.Forms.OnPlatform element is valid with the parent property type. MF1038 Referenced Attribute Member Exists In Parent Type Checks that an attribute resolves to a member within its parent type. MF1039 Property Node Maps To Member In Parent Type Checks that a property node resolves to a member within its parent type. MF1040 Property Setter Node Misuse Inspects for property setters that don't apply to the outer class. For example, if a developer used OnIdiom.Phone inside a OnPlatform element, the OnIdiom.Phone property setter makes no sense within the given context. MF1041 Property Setter Type Mismatch When using MyClass.MyProperty node setter syntax, validate that the inner child node returns a .NET object of the correct type for the property. MF1042 Duplicate Resource Dictionary Keys Validates the each resource entry within a resource dictionary has a unique key. MF1043 Resource Entry Does Not Define Key Validates the elements provided to a resource dictionary supply an x:Key attribute to declare their resource dictionary key. MF1044 Resource Key Conflict Inspects resource key declarations and validates that the resource key is not already defined in other files that are used by this file. MF1045 Unused Resource Inspects that resource dictionary entries are used via the StaticResource markup extension expression within this document. MF1046 Missing Microsoft Schema Inspects at the root xaml node and verifies that it references the Microsoft Xaml schema: http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml . This schema is required for Xamarin Forms Xaml documents. MF1047 Duplicate ShellItem Route Inspects Xamarin.Forms.ShellItem elements and validates that their Route is unique. MF1048 Validate Setter Attached Property Usage Inspects the Property attribute for a Xamarin.Forms.Setter and, when it is referencing an attached property, validates that the namespace, class and attached property exist. MF1049 Setter Property Exists Inspects the Property attribute for a Xamarin.Forms.Setter and validates that it exists in the parents specified TargetType . MF1051 Empty Shell Route Scheme Providing an empty value into the RouteScheme property of a Xamarin.Forms.Shell element will cause the application to crash. This code inspection validates that a value is provided to the RouteScheme property. MF1052 Multiple VisualElements Defined In Shell Content Inspects usages of the Xamarin.Forms.ShellContent and validates that only one page or view is declared within it. MF1053 Shell Requires At Least One Item When using Xamarin.Forms.Shell you must provide at least one item declaration. MF1054 Ambiguous Static Resource Reference Inspects StaticResource expressions and checks if one or more static resources will be returned from the resource expression. MF1055 No Key Provided To Static Resource Expression Inspects StaticResource expressions and validates that a resource key has been provided. MF1056 StaticResource Return Type Mismatch Validates that the symbol returned by a StaticResource expression matches the expected type for the property. MF1057 x:Static Return Type Mismatch Validates that the .NET symbol returned by an x:Static expressions matches the expected type for the property. MF1058 Undefined Static Resource Usage Validates that the element referenced by a StaticResource expression resource lookup resolves to a resource defined in the xaml file. MF1059 Style Is Missing TargetType When a Style is used within XAML, it should always specify a type it targets using the TargetType property. This analysis check inspects for usages of Style that don't assign the TargetType property. MF1060 Style Or Trigger Has Duplicate Setters Inspects Style and Trigger declarations and checks if there is are multiple Setter's for a property. MF1061 Property Setter Does Not Exist In Style TargetType This code inspection looks at Setter elements when they are used inside a Style and validates that the member specified in the Property attribute exists on the type symbol referenced in the parent Style s TargetType attribute. MF1062 Style TargetType Does Not Match BasedOn TargetType Inspects XAML styles that use the BasedOn property to inherit from another style and validates the TargetType of the current style matches the TargetType defined by the BasedOn style. MF1063 Invalid Thickness Attribute Value Inspects attribute properties that use the Xamarin.Forms.Thickness type and checks the value used can be translated to a thickness. For example, Thickness could accidentally be provided 0,5,05 , with the intention of it being 0,5,0,5 ; the first example has three arguments while the second has four. This misuse would cause the app to crash when using inflated XAML or for XAMLC to fail. MF1064 Trigger Is Missing Target Type Inspects XAML elements that derive from Xamarin.Forms.TriggerBase and validates that they include a TargetType attribute MF1065 Trigger TargetType Does Not Match Parent Inspects usages of the TargetType property for a Xamarin.Forms.TriggerBase and validates that the type provided matches the outer XAML node. MF1066 Duplicate Namespace Declaration Checks that an xml namespace points to a unique namespace and assembly. For example if both xmlns:local=\"clr-namespace:MFractor.Licensing.MobileApp\" and xmlns:myassembly=\"clr-namespace:MFractor.Licensing.MobileApp\" were declared, this analyser would warn that they both reference the same assembly and namespace. MF1067 Unresolved Xml Namespace Checks that the namespace used on the xml nodes is defined within the current document. MF1068 Unresolved Xmlns Assembly Checks that the 'assembly' component of an xmlns statement resolves to an assembly referenced by the project. MF1069 Class Does Not Have Attached Property Looks for attached properties (for example Grid.Row ) and validates they exist in the class that they are attempting to use. MF1070 Empty Value Assignment Detects when a boolean, double, long or integer value is being assigned an empty value and will cause a compilation error. MF1071 Obsolete Property Used Checks for attributes that are marked as obsolete/deprecated. MF1072 Unknown Static Property Value For attributes that accept a class object, inspects that the literal value maps to a static property or field in the class type. For example, the LayoutOptions class has the static fields Fill or CentreAndExpand that can be used a literal attribute values. If CentreAndFill was provided (an invalid value), this analyser would inspect the LayoutOptions class for a static field named CentreAndFill and trigger an analysis error when it couldn't be found. MF1074 Validate Value Types Inspects the input provided to attributes that expect value types (int, bool, double etc) and validates that the input is valid. MF1075 Xaml Node Resolves Checks that xaml nodes map to a valid .NET symbol. MF1076 Hexadecimal Value Matches Named Color Inspects HexaDecimal color values and matches them against the named color constants. MF1077 Static Resource Style Target Type Is Incompatible When a static resource expression returns a style, this code inspection verifies that the TargetType of the given style is compatible with MF1078 Thickness Value Can Be Simplified Inspect's thickness attribute values and verifies if the values can be simplified. For example, a thickness value of 20,0,20,0 could be simplified to 20,0 .

As a developer, you can delete all occurrences of an asset in one action instead of needing to track down and delete each density independently. Identifying Image Assets Image assets are tracked differently on Android and iOS projects. The following sections describes how MFractor will identify images that are part of the same image set that forms an asset. Info An image asset is a single image that is used inside an app. This asset may have variations in size and style to adapt the image to different contexts, such as screen pixel density, light and dark modes and localizations. An image set is the set the of files that compose a single asset. When we develop an app we don't reference the individual files of an image set directly, but we of that as a single entity, the image asset. Note Image Assets are Considered Unique Among Projects . An image asset with the same name on iOS and Android projects that are of the same solution will be treated as single Image Asset of that application, considering they are different platform implementations of the same app, thus sharing the same set of assets among them. The rules below describes how MFractor identifies image assets in specific projects, but the tool will scan through all the projects of the solution and provides a unified view. Android When the image manager deletes an image asset in an Android project, it will remove all matching files in the drawable and mipmap folders. For example, let's consider an image asset named logo with the following files project structure: drawable/logo.xml drawable-ldpi/logo.png drawable-mdpi/logo.png drawable-hdpi/logo.png drawable-night-mdpi/logo.png (dark mode version) drawable-landscape-hdpi/logo.png (landscape version ) mipmap-de-ldpi/logo.png (Deutsch translation) mipmap-ldpi/logo.png mipmap-mdpi/logo.png mipmap-hdpi/logo1.png MFractor would delete the following assets: drawable-ldpi/logo.png drawable-night-mdpi/logo.png drawable-landscape-hdpi/logo.png mipmap-de-ldpi/logo.png mipmap-ldpi/logo.png mipmap-mdpi/logo.png MFractor would ignore the following assets: drawable/logo.xml (Excluded as it's an xml drawable) mipmap-hdpi/logo1.png (Excluded as logo1 is not a match with logo). iOS The iOS projects can contain image assets into Image Asset Catalogs or any regular folder. The iOS SDK doesn't enforce any specific place where to put images, but by convention they're generally added to the Resources folder. The image deletion tool track assets differentely weather they are standalone files in folder or assets in a Asset Catalog. Deleting stand-alone images MFractor will identify stand-alone images as an image-set based on its name and density suffix. Images may three primary densities for iOS projects: 1x, 2x and 3x. The former one doesn't add any suffix to the image file name (in practice unused since there are no more supported devices with 1x density screens). The later 2 adds the suffixes as @2x and @3x respectively. For example, considering an image asset named logo with the following files in the project structure: Resources/logo.png Resources/logo@2x.png Resources/logo@3x.png Resources/logo1@2x.png Resources/logo2@3x.png The deletion tool will track and delete the following files as the image set of the logo asset: Resources/logo.png Resources/logo@2x.png Resources/logo@3x.png MFractor will ignore the following files: Resources/logo1@2x.png (Excluded as logo1 is not a match with logo) Resources/logo2@3x.png (Excluded as logo2 is not a match with logo) Deleting images from Asset Catalogs For images in Asset Catalogs MFractor will track them a little differently. Image sets in catalogs are tracked through a metadata file called Contents.json , in the same folder of an image set. The images that compose a set in an asset catalog may contain different names because by default Visual Studio and Xcode preserve the original filenames when importing then using the Asset Catalog tool. For this reason MFractor relies on the metadata file to track the files that compose a set. For example, considering again an image asset named logo with the following files in the project structure: Assets.xcassets/logo.imageset/logo.png Assets.xcassets/logo.imageset/logo@2x.png Assets.xcassets/logo.imageset/logo@3x.png Assets.xcassets/logo.imageset/sample.png Assets.xcassets/logo.imageset/sample@3x.png Assets.xcassets/logo.imageset/other.png Assets.xcassets/logo.imageset/other@2x.png Assets.xcassets/logo.imageset/Contents.json From the files in the project structure we can't define for sure what ones compose the image set. For this reason MFractor will check this information on the Contents.json metadata file. Here we have a simplified snippet of this file: { \"images\" : [ { \"filename\" : \"logo.png\" , \"scale\" : \"1x\" , \"idiom\" : \"universal\" }, { \"filename\" : \"logo@2x.png\" , \"scale\" : \"2x\" , \"idiom\" : \"universal\" }, { \"filename\" : \"logo@3x.png\" , \"scale\" : \"3x\" , \"idiom\" : \"universal\" }, { \"filename\" : \"sample.png\" , \"appearances\" : [ { \"appearance\" : \"luminosity\" , \"value\" : \"dark\" } ], \"scale\" : \"1x\" , \"idiom\" : \"universal\" }, { \"filename\" : \"sample@3x.png\" , \"appearances\" : [ { \"appearance\" : \"luminosity\" , \"value\" : \"dark\" } ], \"scale\" : \"3x\" , \"idiom\" : \"universal\" } ] } From the metadata we can verify that sample.png and sample@3x.png are the dark mode variant of the same image asset, so the deletion tool will delete the following files: Assets.xcassets/logo.imageset/logo.png Assets.xcassets/logo.imageset/logo@2x.png Assets.xcassets/logo.imageset/logo@3x.png Assets.xcassets/logo.imageset/sample.png Assets.xcassets/logo.imageset/sample@3x.png Assets.xcassets/logo.imageset/Contents.json (metadata file is also deleted because its part of the asset definition) MFractor will ignore the following files: Assets.xcassets/logo.imageset/other.png (Not listed in the Contents.json file) Assets.xcassets/logo.imageset/other@2x.png (Not listed in the Contents.json file) Launching The Deletion Tool Solution Explorer The image deletion can be launched from the solution explorer by: Right click on an Android or iOS image file.

Using the Image Importer The image importer tool is presented as a dialog that can be invoked from several places in Visual Studio IDE. The more straightforward is from the MFractor main menu: The MFractor Image Importer tool menu option will only be available if the solution has at least one Xamarin.Android or Xamarin.iOS project. The tool can also be invoked from the context menu of an Android or iOS project, in the Add submenu you should find the option for Image Asset : The Image Importer Tool dialog Window allows you to load a single image that you want to import to the project and then you can set the parameters for your import operation. First select the file you want to import, this will load it in the Preview panes: Now you can customize how the import operation will execute. We will inspect the available options up next. Target Projects MFractor identifies the projects of type Xamarin.Android and Xamarin.iOS that can be import targets. By checking the Include box the image assets will be copied to the selected projects. There are several options that can be set for each of these targets: Image Type : depending on the Target Project you can select how the image will be imported: Android Projects can choose from Drawable or MipMap . Drawables are the default option and MipMaps are commonly used for application icons. In both cases the tool will import images to the corresponding density bucket folder. iOS projects can choose from Asset Catalogs or Bundle Resources . Images imported to Asset Catalogs will be added to Assets.xcassets catalog that is created by the default Xamarin.iOS project template. Bundle Resources images are copied to the Resources folder of the project. In both cases the entries are automatically added to the .csproj with the corresponding Bundle Action to ensure they'll be correctly compiled to the application package. Image Density : also dependant on the Target Project, you can select the maximum image density for the target platform. The tool will automatically add all the images from down to the lowest density on that platform. Options are: Android: xxxhdpi , xxhdpi , xhdpi , hdpi , mdpi and ldpi . iOS: @3x , @2x and @1x . MFractor provides a system-wide configuration to set the minimum image density to which you want Android image assets to be imported. This option is presented in the Settings pane in the MFractor section of Visual Studio Preferences: This pane also allows setting the Default Image Asset Type for import iOS images. Setting the Image Size The image importer tool will detect the image dimensions and automatically suggest it as the image size for the import operation. This size determines how big will be the image on the maximum selected bucket for any of the target projects. MFractor then scale down the images to the correct sizes of each bucket on each target project/platform. It's important to understand how densities sizes are calculated in order to correctly apply the size options for your needs. Currently, the platforms work with densities as of the following table: 0.75x 1.0x 1.5x 2.0x 3.0x 4.0x Android ldpi mdpi hdpi xhdpi xxhdpi xxxhdpi iOS N/A @1x N/A @2x @3x N/A There you can see a correlation between density multipliers and the density bucket on each platform. We can see that Android provide several more densities than iOS although most of them are equivalent between platforms. Also Android provides an maximum higher multiplier of 4.0x that iOS doesn't implement. This is important to understand how image sizes are calculated on the image importer tool. On the bottom pane of the importer dialog window you can preview how the images are going to be imported on the selected target project. The sample image from the following screenshot is a 1600x463 banner. If you check the preview pane of the Android target you will notice that its going to generate a image for each of the densities listed above, applying its multiplier to determine the correct image size: When you select the iOS project, you will notice that there's way less densities to manage, and also that the bigger density is smaller than the image size: This happens because the selected maximum density of the Android target project is greater than the maximum density of the iOS project, so the tool automatically downsizes it to keep the image sizes consistent between platforms. If you set the Image Density of the Android target to xxhdpi and check back the preview pane of the iOS target, you will notice that the maximum density will preserve the maximum size of the image.

As a developer, you gain a birds-eye view of all image assets in your solution and that then allows you to delete, import, search and optimise all images from a centralised location. Opening The Image Manager The image manager is presented as a pad on the IDE by default on the right side of the Window, below the Toolbox , Properties and Document Outline pads. You can access it from several places if hidden: Top Menu By acessing the top menu selecting the Manage Image Assets options. Solution Pad You can right click on a Xamarin.Android and Xamarin.iOS project file and you'll find Manage Image Assets under the Tools menu. Alternatively, double click on and Android or iOS image asset. This will open the image manager, selecting that image in the list. Overview What is an image asset? MFractor works with the concept of Image Assets , where a single asset is composed by a set of files that represent a single image at each possible density supported by Android or iOS devices. This concept is implemented to facilitate managing those assets, because a single item may be represented by a large number of individual files, that can also be shared among projects. For this documentation, every time we use the term Image Asset , we are refering the set of images that form a single element as consumed by the user interface engines of the platforms, and we will use the term Asset File to refer to a specific item of this set. The Image Manager Pad is composed of the following parts: The Assets List : the main listing on the left side of the pane contains all the image assets identified by MFractor in the current solution. The list consider an asset a set of images that compose a single image as recognized by an Android or iOS project. The List of Assets File : when you select an asset from the previous list, MFractor will list the files that compose this asset in this section. Further grouping is provided by project on the Combo Box on the top of this list, where you can select the project of which you want list the files of the asset. The list provides the image size aside with it's path in the solution. The Preview Area : just above the listing of asset files on the Asset, you'll find the preview of the currently selected file along with some metadata of the image: it's current file size and dimensions. The Commands Area : you'll find buttons for the commands available to the image assets on the bottom area of the assets listing. Filtering Image assets You can filter image assets using the search bar on the top of the listing. Start typing and MFractor will filter the items that contains the text you've typed. Note The filtering tool is case-sensitive. Importing Image Assets Click on the Import New Image Asset on the bottom part of the pad to open the Import Image Asset tool. See the section docs for instructions on how to import images. Deleting Image Assets You can delete an Image Asset by selecting the image on the assets list and clicking on the Delete image name on the bottom of the listing. This will present the Delete Image Asset tool dialog, that previews the delete operations that will be run for that asset. You can also right click on a asset of the list and select Delete from the context menu. Click Delete Images button to confirm the operation. Tip For further information about the MFractor Delete Image Asset tool see the docs of the feature . Optimising Image Assets Through the Image Asset Manager you can optimise the all images of your solution, a single Image Asset or a specific Asset File. Please check the Optimising Image Assets docs for details on how to setup image optimization and launch it for the desired items of your solution. Searching For Image Asset Usages The Image Asset Manager allows you to search for places where an Image Asset is referenced in your solutions code. Warning This feature is currently in preview and will search for the exact name of the asset. This may not detect all usages of this image resource and may detect false positives. To Invoke the Search Usage feature you should use the context menu over the Image Asset you want to do the search and select the Find Usages option. MFractor will present the results on the Search Results Pane on the bottom area of the IDE. Drag And Drop The image manager supports drag and drop from the image asset list onto a code file. When you drag and drop an image onto a code file, the image manager will generate code to access that image. For example, given the image logo.png , MFractor will insert the following code: Android AXML : @drawable/logo . Android C# : Resource.Drawable.logo . XAML : logo . C# (Xamarin.Forms) : \"logo.png\" ; Context Actions In both the Image Assets list and the Asset Files list, you may right click on any item to launch a context menu that may provide the following options: Delete Please see Deleting Image Assets Reveal In Finder/Explorer The Reveal In Finder action will open Finder (Mac) or Explorer (Windows) and select that image. Reveal In Project Pad The Reveal Project Pad action will locate the image file in the solution pad. Copy Name To Clipboard The Copy NameTo Clipboard action copies the full file path of that image file to the clipboard.

MFractor works with the concept of Image Assets , where a single asset is composed by a set of files that represent a single image at each possible density supported by Android or iOS devices. This concept is implemented to facilitate managing those assets, because a single item may be represented by a large number of individual files, that can also be shared among projects. For this documentation, every time we use the term Image Asset , we are refering the set of images that form a single element as consumed by the user interface engines of the platforms, and we will use the term Asset File to refer to a specific item of this set. The Image Manager Pad is composed of the following parts: The Assets List : the main listing on the left side of the pane contains all the image assets identified by MFractor in the current solution. The list consider an asset a set of images that compose a single image as recognized by an Android or iOS project. The List of Assets File : when you select an asset from the previous list, MFractor will list the files that compose this asset in this section. Further grouping is provided by project on the Combo Box on the top of this list, where you can select the project of which you want list the files of the asset. The list provides the image size aside with it's path in the solution. The Preview Area : just above the listing of asset files on the Asset, you'll find the preview of the currently selected file along with some metadata of the image: it's current file size and dimensions. The Commands Area : you'll find buttons for the commands available to the image assets on the bottom area of the assets listing.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"image-management/managing-image-assets/#filtering-image-assets","text":"You can filter image assets using the search bar on the top of the listing.

This automated optimisation tool allows you to quickly reduce the size of your assets and produce smaller application binaries. Configuring TinyPNG API Key MFractor relies on TinyPNG for optimizing the image sizes, an industry standard online image optimization service. For the optimization tool to work you should configure a API Key on the MFractor settings page. Creating an API is quick and straighforward. Head to developer API Page of TinyPNG service: All you need to is provide your full name and email. A link will be sent to your address with a link to your Dashboard, where you will be able to copy your key and check the service usage. Note The TinyPNG offers a free tier that allows processing 500 images per month. After passing this limit you'll have to wait until the month to close or subscribe for a paid plan. Copy the API Key from your Dashboard. Back to Visual Studio open the Preferences and go to the MFractor Settings pane. The last option on this page presents a field where you can copy your TinyPNG key. Launching The Optimiser The optimiser tool is avaiable through the Image Asset Manager pad/toolwindow. There you can invoke the optimiser on a single file, an entire asset or all the image files in the current solution. To optimise a single image file Follow the steps to optimise a single image file: On the left-pane of the Image Asset Manager select the asset where the file you want to optimise On the right-pane below the preview, select the project where the file resides In the list below the project selection drop-down, select the file you want to optimise Right click on the file and select Optimise To optimise all files of an asset Follow the steps to optimise all files that compose the image set of a single asset: On the left-pane of the Image Asset Manager select the asset you want to optimise Right click on the file and select Optimise To optimise all images To optimise all image files in the solution, open the Image Asset Manager and click Optimise All Images button, in the bottom part of the left-pane. MFractor will scan all images and present a dialog showing how many optimisation operations will be run for your project: Track your TinyPNG API Usage Always check if your TinyPNG service account has enough compressions credits left for the operations you're about to run. MFractor doesn't check service availability, so the compressions will run until your account run out of credits. If you're using a paid plan, always check your usage before running compressions. TinyPNG bills monthly based on the usage that exceeds the free 500 compressions. MFractor doesn't provide any tool for managing usage or limiting the utilization so this should be managed directly by the end user.

There are various issues that can arise from using the x:Name directive and MFractor inspects for many known issues and provides code-fixes to resolve them. x:Name Has Invalid Characters As an x:Name directive declares a new code-behind field, it's value must follow C#'s identifier name restrictions .

This is done by looking for classes and XAML views that follow industry standard naming convention. Let's consider the following files: LoginPage.xaml - The XAML view. LoginPage.xaml.cs - The code behind for the XAML view. LoginViewModel - The a C# class that is the view model for the LoginPage view. Because these pages share the prefix Login and each has a distinct file extension or suffix, MFractor assumes the following relationships: The .xaml extension denotes that LoginPage.xaml is a xaml view. The .xaml.cs extension and the LoginPage component denotes that LoginPage.xaml.cs is the code behind implementation LoginPage view. The ViewModel suffix implies that LoginViewModel is a view model. When ViewModel is removed from LoginViewModel and Page is removed from LoginPage, the Login component implies that the LoginViewModel is related to the LoginPage XAML view and it's code behind file. MFractor uses these common naming conventions of Page.xaml, Page.xaml.cs and ViewModel to decide that LoginViewModel will probably be the BindingContext for LoginPage. The Page <-> ViewModel naming convention is used by several popular MVVM frameworks such as Prism and FreshMVVM. The following suffixes are supported for XAML views: Page: EG LoginPage.xaml <-> LoginViewModel View: EG LoginView.xaml <-> LoginViewModel The following suffixes are supported for View Models. ViewModel: LoginPage.xaml <-> LoginViewModel PageModel: LoginView.xaml <-> LoginPageModel PageViewModel: LoginView.xaml <-> LoginPageViewModel Model: LoginView.xaml <-> LoginModel VM: LoginView.xaml <-> LoginVM PageVM: LoginView.xaml <-> LoginPageVM","title":"Automatic ViewModel Detection"},{"location":"xamarin-forms/binding-context-resolution/binding-context-evaluation/","text":"Binding Context Evaluation In Xamarin.Forms, all views have the property BindingContext; this specifies the object that a view should data-bind with. When coding with XAML, we can use the x:Static markup extension to reference a static C# property and explicitly provide an instance of a C# class as the binding context: <Entry BindingContext=\"{x:Static local:MyStaticClass.MyStaticProperty}\"/> This is known as the View Model Locator Pattern. We implement a static class named ViewModelLocator and use a static, readonly property to return an instance of the object we want our XAML view to data-bind with. Historically the View Model Locator Pattern has been used to provide design time data to the Xamarin.Forms XAML previewer. For a deeper insight into this pattern, read James Montemagnos excellent View Model Locator article. For example, given a XAML page named LoginPage, we can explicitly provide an instance of LoginViewModel as the binding context like so: ViewModelLocator.cs public namespace MyApp { public static class ViewModelLocator { public static readonly LoginViewModel LoginViewModel = new LoginViewModel(); } } LoginPage.xaml <ContentPage xmlns:local=\"clr-namespace:MyApp;assembly=MyApp\" BindingContext=\"{x:Static local:ViewModelLocator.LoginViewModel}\"/> When MFractor starts analysis on LoginPage.xaml, it will check if any BindingContext properties have been assigned to. As the root ContentPage assigns a binding context, it will inspect the value component of the BindingContext attribute, check if it is a XAML expression and then evaluate it for the return type. For the {x:Static local:ViewModelLocator.LoginViewModel} expression, MFractor will resolve the ViewModelLocator class in the local namespace and then grab the C# type of the LoginViewModel property. This informs MFractor that the page will be bound to a LoginViewModel instance and therefore to analyse all Binding expressions against the LoginViewModel type. Explicit binding context resolution will also work when referencing another element using x:Reference expressions. For example, we can bind the on/off state of a switch to the visibility of a text label like so: <Switch x:Name=\"mySwitch\" /> <Label BindingContext=\"{x:Reference mySwitch}\" IsVisible=\"{Binding IsToggled}\"/> When MFractor analyses the {Binding IsToggled} expression, it will evaluate the {x:Reference mySwitch} expression and use the type of mySwitch as the BindingContext (Xamarin.Forms.Switch). Explicit binding context resolution will always override implicit binding context resolution. If your XAML views are named using the conventions listed above but your page or a view explicitly assigns the BindingContext property then MFractor will use the BindingContext return type instead of the implicit Mvvm relationship.","title":"BindingContext Evaluation"},{"location":"xamarin-forms/binding-context-resolution/binding-context-evaluation/#binding-context-evaluation","text":"In Xamarin.Forms, all views have the property BindingContext; this specifies the object that a view should data-bind with.

Introduction MFractor includes several code analysers to aid on managing the colors in your Xamarin.Forms projects. Those analysers are applied to active XAML documents on the editor and will check any property of the Xamarin.Forms.Color Struct , including any custom or third-party component types. Color analysers helps you with the following types of issues and enhancements: Check for mispelled hex color formats. Check for mispelled color values. Identify colors declared as static resources. Identifying mispelled hex color formats Xamarin.Forms Color Type allows passing a hexadecimal color value in several different formats: #RRGGBB : A color with 32 bit (00-FF) Red, Green and Blue channels. #AARRGGBB : A color with 32 bit (00-FF) Alpha, Red, Green and Blue channels. #RGB : A color with 16 bit (0-F) Red, Green and Blue channels. #ARGB : A color with 16 bit (0-F) Alpha, Red, Green and Blue channels. The color code analysis will check for values begining with an # to verify if they fall on one of above supported formats. If a mispelling format is identified an warning will be shown to the editor. The warning tooltip allows you to invoke the Color Picker tool to pick a valid value for your property: The color picker is a very useful tool for quickly setting a valid color value. You can iterate to it by dragging the Red , Blue , Green and Alpha channels sliders or by directly typing an integer value to its respective boxes. The picker will try to identify an existing named color (one of the static read-only fields declared in the Xamarin.Forms.Color struct ) for the RGB value set, or you can also type one of those suggestions to imediately get the channels filled. By setting a color in the picker and clicking choose, MFractor will set the new value to the property. If the value represents one of the named colors this value will be used instead of the hex value. Example : type brown on the Color field and the picker channels will be automatically set to red 165, Green 42, Blue 42 and Alpha 255 that represents Color.Brown field value of #FFA52A2A . Fixing Mispelled Named Colors Visual Studio provides completion for the named colors on properties of the Color type, even though, typos may happen. This code analysis checks for non-hex values typed on the color properties and suggests fixes to similar named colors. Suppose you have a color property with value of Blu . This is an invalid color value because it doesn't represent a valid named color, nor a hex value and neither a resource reference. This will be thrown as an error at compile time, but with the MFractor code analysis you can identify this issue as you edit your file and get suggestions to quickly fix the issue: By hovering over the typo, the code analysis tooltip will show suggestions of names that closely match the mispelled one. Just click the link to have an instant fix. Applying Named Color to Equivalent hex value Hex values are a useful way of representing and sharing color value, but you can't easily figure a color value just by looking at it (unless you're a very experienced designer). For this reason, its useful to have named colors when they apply, so we can quickly identify what the color value is. This code analysis will check Color properties that has hex values declared to verify if they match one of the named colors available. Suppose you have an element that declares a color with the value #F5F5DC which matches to the Color.Beige named color. A warning will be shown to the color declaration to suggest replacing with the named version: Applying an Existing Color Resource Its a common pattern to set theme Color values at the Resources of the App.xaml file of a Xamarin.Forms project. MFractor can identify if an explicity hex value set to a color property matches an existing resource at any level it could be declared. Suppose you a have a Color entry for the primary color of your app theme, like below: <ResourceDictionary> <Color x:Key= \"primaryColor\" > #7BCCE5 </Color> </ResourceDictionary> At another part of the code, you add an item that will apply this color value, but you didn't remember about the Color resource you've declared before, and you simply copy the hex value over from your style guide: <BoxView Color= \"#7BCCE5\" /> If you hover over the squiggles of the code analysis warning, you'll find information about the existing static resource that matches the hex value you've just typed.

This article outlines how MFractor will resolve your font asset. To accomplish this, MFractor will resolve the font asset referenced by a particular element. This is accomplished via three methods: Resolving the FontFamily through fonts defined by the ExportFontAttribute . Resolving the FontFamily static resource. Resolving the FontFamily via the elements style. Resolving By ExportFontAttribute One of the major features added in Xamarin.Forms 4.5 was EmbeddedFonts ; the ability to include a font asset as an EmbeddedResource in your code project and then use the ExportFontAttribute to expose it to Xamarin.Forms. Example: [assembly: ExportFont(\"FontAwesome.ttf\")] In XAML, we can now reference this font by name (with or without the file extension): <Label FontFamily=\"FontAwesome\"/> <Label FontFamily=\"FontAwesome.ttf\"/> When MFractor encounters a FontFamily that is not a static resource expression, it will inspect the assembly for ExportFontAttribute 's and match the defined font family with either the ExportFontAttribute.FontFileName or ExportFontAttribute.Alias value. Resolving By Static Resource When using custom fonts in XAML, a common method to reference a font is with a static resource expression that returns a string OnPlatform that returns the font for each platform. Consider the following font reference: <OnPlatform x:TypeArguments=\"x:String\" x:Key=\"FontAwesome5ProRegular\"> <On Platform=\"iOS\" Value=\"FontAwesome5Pro-Regular\"/> <On Platform=\"Android\" Value=\"FontAwesomeRegular.ttf#Regular\"/> <On Platform=\"UWP\" Value=\"/Assets/Fonts/FontAwesomeRegular.ttf#Font Awesome 5 Pro\"/> </OnPlatform> <Label FontFamily=\"{StaticResource FontAwesome5ProRegular}\"/> In this OnPlatform , we reference the font asset by its postscript name, FontAwesome5Pro-Regular , on iOS . on Android via the asset name and font style FontAwesomeRegular.ttf#Regular and on UWP by its assets path plus the typographic family name. When MFractor encounters a FontFamily that references an OnPlatform that returns a string, it evaluates the expression to discover the iOS/Android font asset and then attempts to load that font asset. Resolving By Style MFractor can also resolve the font family declared by a style. Consider the following style declaration: <OnPlatform x:TypeArguments=\"x:String\" x:Key=\"FontAwesome5ProRegular\"> <On Platform=\"iOS\" Value=\"FontAwesome5Pro-Regular\"/> <On Platform=\"Android\" Value=\"FontAwesomeRegular.ttf#Regular\"/> </OnPlatform> <Style x:Key=\"labelStyle\" TargetType=\"Label\" FontFamily=\"{StaticResource FontAwesome5ProRegular}\" <Label Style=\"{StaticResource labelStyle}\"/> As the Label does not use the FontFamily property, MFractor then tries to locate the Style property.

Consider the following XAML code: <Label FontFamily=\"{StaticResource FontAwesome5ProRegular}\" Text=\"&#xf00c;\" This Label uses the &#xf00c; icon from the FontAwesome5ProRegular font asset. From a maintainability perspective, it's very difficult for a developer to understand what the icon code &#xf00c; refers to. To make it easier to understand what a particular references, MFractor include glyph tooltips.

Introduction StackLayout is one of the basic layouts provided by Xamarin.Forms and is a common starting point when composing a new view, being fast and easy to use. But it's common to transform a StackLayout into a Grid when the layout starts to become complex, or you need to rethink it to have new column or row. MFractor makes easy to convert an existing StackLayout into a Grid with the adequate rows and columns definitions and its elements in place. Using the Converter The Convert StackLayout to Grid tool is presented as a XAML Code Action. The option becomes available to the Refactor menu on the Context Menu of a StackLayout element. Consider a layout for reporting progress to the user. It's composed of an ActivityIndicator , a Label and Button stacked vertically: <StackLayout> <ActivityIndicator IsRunning= \"True\" /> <Label HorizontalTextAlignment= \"Center\" Text= \"Processing...\" /> <Button HorizontalOptions= \"Center\" Text= \"Cancel\" /> </StackLayout> We may want to transform it into a Grid , so we can add a second column to add new button button to right of the current one. Right-click on the StackLayout element and on the context menu you should find the option Convert StackLayout to Grid on the Refactor menu: In Visual Studio for Windows this code action will appear in the quick fix menu, the little screwdriver icon that appears to the left of the current line being edited. If you place the cursor under a StackLayout declaration and click on the icon or use the Ctrl + . keyboard shortcut, the option will appear o the menu: Note The current verison of MFractor for Visual Studio Mac doe not support quick fix actions in XAML, however, this feature should be available in a future version. By applying this code action, your StackLayout declaration will be transformed into an equivalent Grid declaration, just like below: <Grid HorizontalOptions= \"Center\" VerticalOptions= \"Center\" Padding= \"12\" > <Grid.RowDefinitions> <RowDefinition Height= \"Auto\" /> <RowDefinition Height= \"Auto\" /> <RowDefinition Height= \"Auto\" /> </Grid.RowDefinitions> <ActivityIndicator Grid.Row= \"0\" IsRunning= \"True\" /> <Label Grid.Row= \"1\" HorizontalTextAlignment= \"Center\" Text= \"Processing...\" /> <Button Grid.Row= \"2\" HorizontalOptions= \"Center\" Text= \"Cancel\" /> </Grid> The conversion to Grid will keep all the properties previously applied to the StackLayout on the trasformed grid declaration. Depending on the Orientation property, the ColumnsDefinitions or RowDefinitions will be created to match the number of elements in the stack. For Vertical (the default) stacks row definitions will be created and for Horizontal column definitions will be created. The conversion will also add the correspondent Grid.Column or Grid.Row properties on the child elements. The conversion will also verify the VerticalOptions (for vertical stacks) or HorizontalOptions (for horizontal stacks) Exapnsion option of each child element to determine the column width or row height of its corresponding position: For elements that Expand , the row or column defitinion will apply the * size For elements that doesn't declare the Expand, the row or column defiition will apply the Auto size Note There's no reverse operation of StackLayout to Grid conversion. If you need to revert the operation you should use the Undo command of the editor.

Those commands allows you to: Declare a new Grid element including its boilerplate code Declare Row or Column definitions for auto and star widht/height Declare the Row or Column or the Span of child elements of a grid Using the Grid Intellisense Features The Grid intellisense appears on the appropriate contexts when editing XAML files. On the next sections we will build a login form in an XAML Page using the Grid layout. This layout will have 3 rows and two columns, where the first column will have the labels and the second column the entries, and the third row will span among the columns to add the login button. The result will look as below: Grid Boilerplate Code Completion To start our login form we will declare a new Grid inside a Frame element in a ContentPage . The frame itself will be inside a root grid element. This allows to produce a login form that looks like a floating card on the screen. Start with the following XAML code for the page: <ContentPage xmlns= \"http://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms\" xmlns:x= \"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml\" x:Class= \"MFractor.Samples.Pages.GridSamplesPage\" > <Grid> <Frame> </Frame> </Grid> </ContentPage> Place the cursor inside the blank line on the Frame element (row number 7) and type an opening angle bracket ( < ) to declare a new XML element. The Intellisense suggestions will appear: When the Intellisense suggestions is open you can start typing to filter what you need. Hit the G and r keys, and the suggestion for Grid (Boilerplate) should appear at the end of the list: The intellisense tooltip provides a little preview of what will be generated to you. Select the option with either the cursor keys or the mouse and type Enter or Tab to apply the suggestion. The editor will add the declaration of a Grid with the boilerplate for declaring its Rows and Column definitions like the snippet below: <Grid> <Grid.ColumnDefinitions> </Grid.ColumnDefinitions> <Grid.RowDefinitions> </Grid.RowDefinitions> </Grid> Grid Row and Column Shorthand Completions Next we need to declare the Columns and Rows definitions of our grid. This tells the Xamarin.Forms Grid engine how it will apply the available space to it's children elements. Row and Column definitions declares their width or height based on one of the 3 unit types: Auto , Proportional (also know as star, declared with the * char) or Absolute . Tip For more information about the Grid Rows and Columns declaration see the Official Xamarin.Forms docs for the Grid . With the MFractor Intellisense completions for Grid you can quickly declare rows and columns definitions. First lets declare our Column Definitions. There will be two Columns, the first will by automatically sized and the second will be proportional. Start a new line on the Grid.ColumDefinitions element and typpe an opening angle bracket to start a new element declaration. Intellisense appears and you should immediatly see the * and Auto options available to the list: Both are completions provided by MFractor. For the first column, select the Auto option and type Enter or Tab to apply the completion. MFractor will add a new ColumDefinition entry like below: <ColumnDefinition Width= \"Auto\" /> Repeat the steps to add a new proportional column definition by selecting the * option in the list. It will add the following definition: <ColumnDefinition Width= \"*\" /> Note You can still type to filter the options even when they already appear on the list. This would save some keystrokes or having to move the mouse to the wanted element. Next repeat the same process to add 3 new Row Definitions, all of the proportional height. The end result of your grid definition should be as follows: <Grid> <Grid.ColumnDefinitions> <ColumnDefinition Width= \"Auto\" /> <ColumnDefinition Width= \"*\" /> </Grid.ColumnDefinitions> <Grid.RowDefinitions> <RowDefinition Height= \"*\" /> <RowDefinition Height= \"*\" /> <RowDefinition Height= \"*\" /> </Grid.RowDefinitions> </Grid> Grid Row and Column Location Completions The last step for our login form is to declare its containing elements. We will declare two Label elements, two Entry elements and a Button element. We'll be using the MFractor intellisense grid location suggestion to easily define where our elements should be put in the available rows and columns of the grid. First, let's declare the labels. Inside the Grid we declared before add a new Label declaration. When you hit space to start adding attributes to the element, intellisense will list suggested properties of the label. Type G then r to filter the list and you should see the suggestions for the available columns and rows of the Grid: Those are the suggestions provided by the MFractor Grid Intellisense location feature. Notice that when you select a suggestion and wait a second a tooltip appears showing details about the width or height of the column or row in question. Important The grid location intellisense completion only appears for Grid elements that declares rows or columns definitions. A plain Grid element will not suggest any completion, because MFractor is unable to infer how may rows and columns the grid may contain. If you don't find those suggestions check the rows and columns definitions. For this first label we want to add it to the first row and the first column of the grid, so use the completions to quickly add the attached properties to the label. Its final declaration should be like below: <Label Grid.Column= \"0\" Grid.Row= \"0\" VerticalOptions= \"Center\" Text= \"Username\" /> Repeat the steps to create a new label, but change the Grid.Row property to 1 and the Text property to Password . Next add the declarations for the Entry elements, the code rest of the code for this part of the form is as follows: <Label Grid.Column= \"0\" Grid.Row= \"1\" VerticalOptions= \"Center\" Text= \"Password\" /> <Entry Grid.Column= \"1\" Grid.Row= \"0\" Placeholder= \"Your username\" /> <Entry Grid.Column= \"1\" Grid.Row= \"1\" IsPassword= \"True\" Placeholder= \"Your password\" /> Use the IntelliSense completions to easily fill the row and column information of each element. Grid Row and Column Span Completions The last part is to add the login button. It will take the entire third row of the grid, so we should add a column span to allow it use the entire width of the grid. First you should add the declaration of the button adding its row and column locations. As in the preview iterations, hit a new line to add a new attribute for the column span and start typing G and r , the suggestions for either column and row span should appear wiht intellisense: The final button declaration should be as follow: <Button Grid.Column= \"0\" Grid.Row= \"2\" Grid.ColumnSpan= \"2\" Text= \"Login\" /> Note For the span completions to appear you should declare both the Grid.Row and Grid.Column for that element, so MFractor can calculate the available span options for each direction. Summary On this tutorial document we've checked how to use the MFractor Grid Intellisense features to quickly produce a new Grid layout for a login forms in Xamarin.Forms. The complete source code for this tutorial is available at GitHub on our samples repository.

Inside the Grid we declared before add a new Label declaration. When you hit space to start adding attributes to the element, intellisense will list suggested properties of the label. Type G then r to filter the list and you should see the suggestions for the available columns and rows of the Grid: Those are the suggestions provided by the MFractor Grid Intellisense location feature.

A plain Grid element will not suggest any completion, because MFractor is unable to infer how may rows and columns the grid may contain. If you don't find those suggestions check the rows and columns definitions. For this first label we want to add it to the first row and the first column of the grid, so use the completions to quickly add the attached properties to the label. Its final declaration should be like below: <Label Grid.Column= \"0\" Grid.Row= \"0\" VerticalOptions= \"Center\" Text= \"Username\" /> Repeat the steps to create a new label, but change the Grid.Row property to 1 and the Text property to Password .

Introduction In Xamarin.Forms there are a few ways of declaring Thickness values on XAML files. Novices tend to get confused by the available ways of doing this, and experience programmers can also fall on typos. This code analysis tries to aid you on identifying mismatches and cases where the declaration can be simplified. Declaring Thicknesses Thicknesses values can be declared mainly to Padding and Margin properties of XAML (althought other custom components may use it for other purposes). The Thickness type is a struct that declares four main properties: Left, Right, Top, Bottom. It's used to represent the of spacing of of each of those four directions. Suppose you want to declare a Label that has a margin around itself of 8 points on its left and right sides and 16 points on its top and bottom: <Label Text= \"Thickness Sample\" Margin= \"8,16,8,16\" /> When declaring a Thickness you pass the value of each side separeted by a comma in the following order: [left],[top],[right],[bottom] . I personally like to think of a line going around a box starting from its left side until it closes itself, its how I always remember this order of sides. It turns out that the values for left and right are the same, as the values for the bottom and bottom. This is a so common scenario that Xamarin.Forms allows you to simplify this declaration using only 2 values: <Label Text= \"Thickness Sample\" Margin= \"8,16\" /> This is equivalent to the previous declaration. The first number refers to margin that will be set to the left and right of the label (referred to as horizontal size ), and second refers to its top and bottom (referred to as vertical size ). The code analysis will check for such declarations and suggest you to simplify then: But wait, there's more! Sometimes you wish to apply the same margin value to every side. This is called uniform size and you can declare it as a single value: <Label Text= \"Thickness Sample\" Margin= \"16\" /> This will apply a margin of 16 points to each side of this label. The analyzer also identifies declarations that are considered uniform, such as 16,16,16,16 or 16,16 and provides suggestion for simplification. Invalid Values Any values that falls out off the patterns presented on the previous section are invalid thickness declarations.

The official documentation provides further information about the feature itself. To create a Value Converter you need to create a class that implements the IValueConverter interface and then reference it on the Resources Dictionary of the Page or Application that you wish to use it. That's where the Value Converter Wizard comes in, to facilitate this creation and reference, by providing a stub of the converter and let you focus on the conversion logic. Using the Wizard The Wizard can be invoked from MFractor Main Menu, under the Wizards sub-menu. Notice that the option will only appear if the loaded solution contains a Xamarin.Forms project. The Wizard Window is divided in two sections: parameters and preview. The parameters control the behaviour of the newly created Value Converter and the options are as follows: Name and Location Parameters Name : Required. The name of the Value Converter, will also be used to name the file that will hold the code. By convention Converters adds a Converter suffix to its name. Infer Input/Output Types : MFractor can infer the input and output data types based on the name you set for the converter. As an example, if you name a converter like IntToBoolConverter it will infer that the input parameter is of type int and the output parameter will be a bool . Please see the Automatic Type Inference documentation to learn more. Folder : the folder where the converter will be created inside the project. Defaults to Converters . Type Parameters Optionally you can specify the types for the arguments you can use to process a value converter. The default code snippet for generating a value converter adds type-casting to the chosen types for each argument. Those fields expects a valid .NET/C# data-type Those parameters are optional and if omitted will default to object . Input Type Represents the type of the input parameter that is the data that is been passed to the converter from the source binding property. As an example, if your View Model declares a string property and it's bound to a property that uses your converter, this value is passed through value argument of the Convert method. In the default code snippet the value argument will be cast to the input local variable on the method. Output Type Represents the type of the output parameter, that is the data that will be returned from the converter. This information is used to feed the ValueConversion attribute that is added to your Value Converter on the default Code Snippet. Even though not being used directly in the method body, this information is used by the Analyzers to identify when you used a converter on a property which the type is different from what is expected to be returned. Parameter Type Value converters allow passing an additional parameter that can be used for further customize its behavior. Parameters are passed along with the binding declaraction on the property, such as: <Label Text= \"{Binding Text, Converter={StaticResource converterReference}, ConverterParameter='parameter data'}\" /> The value parameter data is passed through the parameter argument on the Convert method. In this case the value is a string, but you can also bind to the converter parameter itself. The Parameter Type field allows you to specify the type of this parameter and it will be made available through the param local variable on the method body cast to this type.

This allows us to ensure a consistent user interface and organises the maintenance of a visual appearance into a single place. A style is composed of the following syntax structures: The Style tag declares the style. The TargetType attribute specifies the type that the style applies to. The x:Key declares a resource key we can use to lookup this style. If no x:Key is defined, the style is implicit and is automatically applied to all elements matching TargetType in the scope. The BasedOn and BaseKey The inner Setter element(s) targets a Property on the specified TargetType and initialises it with a Value .

Introduction Styles are a basic construction block for UI components that allows configuring a set of common properties that we may want to apply to several views. They're very useful, but also, very hard to manage. With MFractor XAML Style toolset, which includes the Style Extraction Tool and the Matching Style Code Analysis, you can quickly create styles from existing views and identify ones which a existing style may apply. How to Extract a style The XAML Style extraction tool is presented as a Code Action in the XAML editor. The option becomes available to the context menu when the cursor is placed over any XAML element. For example, considering you have the declaration of a Label with some properties set: <Label HorizontalTextAlignment= \"Center\" FontFamily= \"{StaticResource OpenSans}\" FontSize= \"Large\" Text= \"Welcome to MFractor Docs!\" /> If you right-click on the Label declaration, the extraction tool will be available as option on the Refactor menu: Selecting this option will present the XAML Style Editor dialog, that allows you to extract the properties currently set for the select element (or any additional properties you wish) into a new style, and substitute the properties declaration with the newly created style. Configuring the Style Extraction The extraction dialog offer several options to control how the extraction will be done. Name The name of the new style. This will be used as the key for the Resource Dictionary entry of the style declaration, and is the key to reference on the Style property of a XAML element. TargetType The TargetType is the .NET Fully Qualified Name of the type to which the new style is intended to be applied. In the example above, we are extracting a style from a Label component, which is a native Xamarin.Forms component represented by the Xamarin.Forms.Label type. The value you set here will be used on the TargetType property of the style declaration in XAML, and defines the type of components to which the style can be applied. By default MFractor will fill in with the type from where you\u00b4ve invoked the Code Action, but you can change to any type you wish. The more specific is the type you set as the Target of your style, the more properties of this type becomes available to the setters of the style, but you can also create more generic styles by referencing a common ancestor of the XAML elements, like View or VisualElement . A style with one of those target types may be applied both to a Button or a Label , as to any component that derives from those base classes. Target Type Xmlns This is a second field related to the Target Type declaration. This one is used when you're extracting a style that you may wish to apply to non-standard Xamarin.Forms components, such as custom XAML Views or Third-Party components. Here you specify the single name of the XML namespace you want to declare to reference the type. Adding this information will impact how the Target Type field is rendered on the code of the new style. For example, if you set this field views , the output code will be: <Style x:Key= \"[styleName]\" TargetType= \"views:Label\" > <!-- The rest of the style declaration --> </Style> File The File field is a drop-down that you can select where to add the new style that will be created. Defaults to the current XAML from where you've invoked the code action, but you can also add the style to the App.xaml file of the project (if exists) and make the new style shared among the whole application. Parent The XAML Styles framework allows the creation of a hierarchy of styles, much like you can do with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS, which are also available to Xamarin.Forms components but currently not supported by the MFractor tooling). This means that you can create more generic styles that can be used as the base or template of a new style. When you create a hierarchy of styles, every property set on a parent style is propagated to the child ones, unless a property is explicitly overriden by being declared on this child. Note There are several ways of organizing styles into hierarchies but this topic is beyond the scope of this documentation. Parenting also has implications on dynamic styles, that allows it to be dynamically changed during the runtime of the application, typically for applying different themes, such as light and dark variations of the app visuals. The XAML Style Extraction tool allows you to specify the parent of the new style. There are two fields to this section: Parent Type : a drop-down that allows selecting between BaseResourceKey and BasedOn properties to specify the parent resolution. Resource Key : the text field below the parent type where you can type the resource key of the style that should be parent of this one. Combined, this two fields controls how the declaration of the parent will be added to the new style that will be generated. For a BaseResourceKey parent type, the output will be: BaseResourceKey=\"[ParentResourceKey]\" For a BasedOn parent type, the output will be: BasedOn=\"{StaticResource [ParentResourceKey]}\" If you leave the parent resource key field blank the parent declaration will be supressed. Properties The Properties section presents a grid that allows you to define which properties you want to include to the new style. MFractor will automatically load all the properties it find from the element declaration in the XAML. This tool allows you to: Check/Uncheck a single property entry to be added or excluded from the new style Change value of a property By clicking on the checkbox to Show All Properties , MFractor will load every property from the specified target type, allowing you to include properties that wasn't initially declared on the component from where you've invoked the code action: In the field above the list you can type for searching for specific properties: This tool allow for fine-grained tuning of the new style you want to create and is a powerful editor to avoid having to type all the setters on the XAML style. Previewing the new Style The right pane of the Extraction dialog presents a preview of the style that will be generated, based on the properties previously set. This allows you to review your settings before executing the extraction. The default snippet for the style generation is: <Style x:Key= \"[styleName]\" TargetType= \"[TargetType]\" BaseResourceKey= \"[ParentResouceKey]\" BasedOn= \"{StaticResource [ParentResourceKey]}\" > <Setter Property= \"[PropertyName]\" Value= \"[PropertyValue]\" /> <!-- Repeats for each property set in the dialog... --> </Style> Notice that BaseResourceKey and BasedOn are mutually excludent based on the selection you make from the Parent options, like mentioned in the Parent section. Extracting the Style By clicking on the Extract Styles button the extraction will be processed accordingly to the options you've set. The newly created style will be applied to the element where you have invoked the tool and all the properties selected to be included in the new style will be removed from its declaration. Following on our previous example, if we create a new style with the name defaultLabel and include all the properties previously set to the component this is the end result: <Label Style= \"{StaticResource defaultLabel}\" /> Summary The extraction XAML Style tool allows you to quickly extract common properties that you may want to set on several controls into a XAML Style. MFractor also provides the Matching Style Code Analysis that helps identify places where existing styles can be applied.

This means that you can create more generic styles that can be used as the base or template of a new style. When you create a hierarchy of styles, every property set on a parent style is propagated to the child ones, unless a property is explicitly overriden by being declared on this child. Note There are several ways of organizing styles into hierarchies but this topic is beyond the scope of this documentation. Parenting also has implications on dynamic styles, that allows it to be dynamically changed during the runtime of the application, typically for applying different themes, such as light and dark variations of the app visuals. The XAML Style Extraction tool allows you to specify the parent of the new style. There are two fields to this section: Parent Type : a drop-down that allows selecting between BaseResourceKey and BasedOn properties to specify the parent resolution. Resource Key : the text field below the parent type where you can type the resource key of the style that should be parent of this one. Combined, this two fields controls how the declaration of the parent will be added to the new style that will be generated.

Note Most of the Binding Expressions Analysis relies on a implicit or explicit Binding Context. Make sure to understand how MFractor resolves the Binding Context of a file to ensure the analysis are correctly applied. Data-Binding Expression Analysis Binding Expressions must declare a Path that resolves to a public property of the Binding Context and the data types must match. Check out the Data Binding Bascis docs for more information about Binding Expressions. The code analysis helps you validate those requirements.

Check-out the Automatic View Model Detection docs to understand how MFractor identify View Models. Those features appears to Bindable Properties on the objects you declare to your XAML files and depending on the context and conditions of your code. Expression Binding IntelliSense Binding Expressions are XAML Markup Extensions that allows you to describe how a property is bound. A simple expression just describes to which property of the Binding Context that property should be bound to, such as: <Entry Placeholder= \"Enter your name\" Text= \"{Binding Name}\" /> The example above bounds the Text property of the entry field to the Name property of the context. Using the MVVM pattern we normaly set the context to a View Model class specific to that view. When a View has a View Model class related to it, MFractor will automatically identify the class properties and suggest them as you type your Binding Expression, like the following example: MFractor also validates your Binding Expressions with the Data-Binding Code Analysis tools. Shorthand Binding IntelliSense This is similar to the previous one, but it appears as suggestion when you start typing on any bindable property that doesn't have a Binding Expression declared. In the following example we want to bind the Text property of the Entry component to an Email property that already exists in our View Model: Notice that the tooltip provides all information about the source of the property and a preview of the code that will be inserted. Generating Commands and Properties MFractor can generate Commands and Properties to your View Model directly from the XAML editor. This option appears as an Action on the Intellisense menu.

This is normally a two step process where you need to create the Page/View and then a new class file for it's View Model. Also, you'll probably need to setup the View Model that usually derives from a base class, and you may also wish to change the Page/View to derive from a different class the default templates. Those are recurring time-consuming, error prone and boring tasks. Enters the MVVM Wizard . This is a simple tool to allow you to quickly and easly create a new MVVM Component based on the standards and conventions you set once for the solution you're working on. Info A MVVM Component is considered the set of files that compose a Xamarin.Forms Page or View component with its corresponding View Model: the XAML file, its code-behind and the View Model class file. Using the MVVM Wizard The MVVM Wizard is presented as a dialog that can be invoked from MFractor Top Level Wizards menu: This option becomes visible when you're working on a solution with at least one Xamarin.Forms project. By selecting it the Wizard dialog will be presented. Wizard Options The Wizard is pretty simple and only asks you about two pieces of information: Target Project A drop-down allowing the selection of the project where the pieces of the MVVM Components will be created. Name The name of the MVVM Component you're going to create. You should provide the base name without any suffixes. They'll be added to the file/class names accordingly to the standard conventions: View files will append the Page suffix View Model files will append the ViewModel suffix. You can change this behavior on the Wizard Settings . Previewing the files The MVVM Wizard allows you to preview the files that will be generated. In the middle section you'll find two panes: The left pane allows you to preview the files of the View , either the XAML and its code-behind file. You can switch between then using the drop-down. The right pane allows to preview the View Model file. Note Even though the preview panes allows for editing its contents, the changes won't be persisted on the generated code. Wizard Settings As we've seen in the previous section, the usage of the Wizard is very straightforward, as it is made to be quick and simple to use. By default it will use the most common conventions we've captured from the Xamarin community. Yet, the wizard is powerful enough to allow for further customization of those conventions. By clicking on the Settings button of the dialog by the right side of the Name field, you will be presented with the Project MVVM Settings , which allows will to customize every aspect of the wizard. Wizard Settings Options The Project MVVM Settings dialog allows configuring several aspects of the MVVM Component generation. This section provides an in-depth description of each of this options. View Project A drop-down field allowing you to select the project where the View (xaml and code-behind) part of the MVVM Component should be created. This allows fine-grained tuning on solutions where you may have separate projects for hosting View and View Model files. View Suffix Allows you to specify the suffix that will be added to the file name of the View. This affects the files and class names for that View. Defaults to Page View Folder Allows you to specify in which folder inside the View Project you want the View files (XAML and the code-behind) to be created. You may specify sub-folders by using slash separator / . Defaults to Pages View Base Class and XML Namespace This is a pair of related fields and allows you to specify the base class for the View component being created. Most Xamarin.Forms projects implements a custom base Page or View class for shared logic. You should provide the FQN (Fully Qualified Name) of the type to be used as base class. This settings affects the behavior of the wizard in the following ways: In the XAML File : a XML namespace will be added to the root element to import the namespace where the class is declared. The root element will be changed to <namespace:ClassName> to reference the base class in the XAML code. In the Code-Behind File : the class will derive from the typed base class. View Base Class defaults to Xamarin.Forms.ContentPage View Base Class XML Namespace defaults to pages Binding Context Initialisation In the MVVM Pattern the BindingContext property of the View part is usually initialized with an instance of the View Model. This may be done in several ways, depending on the conventions or additional frameworks you may use for your project. The MVVM Wizard can add initialization code to the new MVVM Component and you can choose the initialization strategy from 3 templates. Info The first two options for BindingContext initialization relies on the View Model class having a parameterless constructor. If your implementation of the View Model relies on custom initialization, such as relying on dependency injection, you should avoid using those initializers. Initialise BindingContext in Code-Behind This option will append initialization code in the code-behind class of the View file, and affects the behavior of the MVVM Wizard in the following ways: Adds a public automatic property named ViewModel of the type of the View Model class. This property resolves to casting the BindingContext property to the type of the View Model class. Initializes the BindingContext with a new instance of the View Model class. This code snippet examples the additions to the code-behind code: using System ; namespace MFractor.Samples.Pages { public partial class Page : Xamarin . Forms . ContentPage { public MFractor . Samples . ViewModels . ViewModel ViewModel => BindingContext as MFractor . Samples . ViewModels . ViewModel ; public Page () { BindingContext = new MFractor . Samples . ViewModels . ViewModel (); InitializeComponent (); } } } Initialise BindingContext in XAML This option will append initialization code in the XAML View file, and affects the behavior of the MVVM Wizard in the following ways: Adds a XML Namespace declaration named viewModels to reference the namespace of the View Model class file. Adds a declaration of the View Model object to the BindingContext property below the root View element. This code snippet examples the additions to the View code: <ContentPage xmlns:x= \"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml\" xmlns= \"http://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms\" x:Class= \"MFractor.Samples.Pages.Page\" xmlns:viewModels= \"clr-namespace:MFractor.Samples.ViewModels\" > <ContentPage.BindingContext> <viewModels:ViewModel x:Key= \"ViewModel\" /> </ContentPage.BindingContext> </ContentPage> Register Withing Application.RegisterTypes Prism is a framework for easing the development of XAML applications, and is becoming a popular choice for Xamarin.Forms apps. It can automatically binds the View Model with its View, which also allows for View Model navigation, one of the most popular features of the framework. To take advantage of this feature you must register your Views and View Models at the application Startup. MFractor allows for automatically adding this registration for the new MVVM Component being created. When you select this binding initialization method the MVVM Wizard will add the registration of the View and View Model parts being created to the RegisterTypes method in the App class file. This code snippet examples the code that is added to the files: protected override void RegisterTypes ( IContainerRegistry containerRegistry ) { // // Previous container registrations containerRegistry . RegisterForNavigation < Pages . HomePage , ViewModels . HomeViewModel >(); } ViewModel Project A drop-down field allowing you to select the project where the View Model part of the MVVM Component should be created. This allows fine-grained tuning on solutions where you may have separate projects for hosting View and View Model files. ViewModel Suffix Allows you to specify the suffix that will be added to the class name of the View Model. Defaults to ViewModel ViewModel Folder Allows you to specify in which folder inside the View Model Project you want the View Model file to be created. You may specify sub-folders by using slash separator / . Defaults to ViewModels ViewModel Base Class Allows you to specify the class to which the View Model class will derive when the MVVM Component is created. You should provide a .NET Fully Qualified Name of the type to be used as base class. Setting a value for this field affects the wizard so it will add the using statement for the namespace of the class and add the inheritance declaration. If this field is left blank, MFractor will supress the declaration of a base class for the View Model. Defaults to empty. MFractor can aid you in finding the most likely View Model base class based on your project existing View Models. With this feature all the existing View Model classes will be inspected and the mostly used base class among the the files will be suggested as the base class setting. To use this feature click on the wand button on the right side of the ViewModel Base Class field: MFractor will consider a class as a View Model based on all the previous settings from this dialog. So for the defaults settings, it will scan the files the View Model Project , inside the View Model Folder whose the class names end with the View Model Suffix .

This is normally a two step process where you need to create the Page/View and then a new class file for it's View Model. Also, you'll probably need to setup the View Model that usually derives from a base class, and you may also wish to change the Page/View to derive from a different class the default templates. Those are recurring time-consuming, error prone and boring tasks. Enters the MVVM Wizard . This is a simple tool to allow you to quickly and easly create a new MVVM Component based on the standards and conventions you set once for the solution you're working on.
