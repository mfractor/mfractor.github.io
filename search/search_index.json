This is done by looking for classes and XAML views that follow industry standard naming convention. Let's consider the following files: LoginPage.xaml - The XAML view. LoginPage.xaml.cs - The code behind for the XAML view. LoginViewModel - The a C# class that is the view model for the LoginPage view. Because these pages share the prefix Login and each has a distinct file extension or suffix, MFractor assumes the following relationships: The .xaml extension denotes that LoginPage.xaml is a xaml view. The .xaml.cs extension and the LoginPage component denotes that LoginPage.xaml.cs is the code behind implementation LoginPage view. The ViewModel suffix implies that LoginViewModel is a view model. When ViewModel is removed from LoginViewModel and Page is removed from LoginPage, the Login component implies that the LoginViewModel is related to the LoginPage XAML view and it's code behind file. MFractor uses these common naming conventions of Page.xaml, Page.xaml.cs and ViewModel to decide that LoginViewModel will probably be the BindingContext for LoginPage. The Page - ViewModel naming convention is used by several popular MVVM frameworks such as Prism and FreshMVVM. The following suffixes are supported for XAML views: Page: EG LoginPage.xaml - LoginViewModel View: EG LoginView.xaml - LoginViewModel The following suffixes are supported for View Models. ViewModel: LoginPage.xaml - LoginViewModel PageModel: LoginView.xaml - LoginPageModel PageViewModel: LoginView.xaml - LoginPageViewModel Model: LoginView.xaml - LoginModel VM: LoginView.xaml - LoginVM PageVM: LoginView.xaml - LoginPageVM","title":"Automatic ViewModel Detection"},{"location":"xamarin-forms/binding-context-resolution/binding-context-evaluation/","text":"Binding Context Evaluation In Xamarin.Forms, all views have the property BindingContext; this specifies the object that a view should data-bind with. When coding with XAML, we can use the x:Static markup extension to reference a static C# property and explicitly provide an instance of a C# class as the binding context: Entry BindingContext= {x:Static local:MyStaticClass.MyStaticProperty} / This is known as the View Model Locator Pattern. We implement a static class named ViewModelLocator and use a static, readonly property to return an instance of the object we want our XAML view to data-bind with. Historically the View Model Locator Pattern has been used to provide design time data to the Xamarin.Forms XAML previewer. For a deeper insight into this pattern, read James Montemagnos excellent View Model Locator article. For example, given a XAML page named LoginPage, we can explicitly provide an instance of LoginViewModel as the binding context like so: ViewModelLocator.cs public namespace MyApp { public static class ViewModelLocator { public static readonly LoginViewModel LoginViewModel = new LoginViewModel(); } } LoginPage.xaml ContentPage xmlns:local= clr-namespace:MyApp;assembly=MyApp BindingContext= {x:Static local:ViewModelLocator.LoginViewModel} / When MFractor starts analysis on LoginPage.xaml, it will check if any BindingContext properties have been assigned to. As the root ContentPage assigns a binding context, it will inspect the value component of the BindingContext attribute, check if it is a XAML expression and then evaluate it for the return type. For the {x:Static local:ViewModelLocator.LoginViewModel} expression, MFractor will resolve the ViewModelLocator class in the local namespace and then grab the C# type of the LoginViewModel property. This informs MFractor that the page will be bound to a LoginViewModel instance and therefore to analyse all Binding expressions against the LoginViewModel type. Explicit binding context resolution will also work when referencing another element using x:Reference expressions. For example, we can bind the on/off state of a switch to the visibility of a text label like so: Switch x:Name= mySwitch / Label BindingContext= {x:Reference mySwitch} IsVisible= {Binding IsToggled} / When MFractor analyses the {Binding IsToggled} expression, it will evaluate the {x:Reference mySwitch} expression and use the type of mySwitch as the BindingContext (Xamarin.Forms.Switch). Explicit binding context resolution will always override implicit binding context resolution. If your XAML views are named using the conventions listed above but your page or a view explicitly assigns the BindingContext property then MFractor will use the BindingContext return type instead of the implicit Mvvm relationship.","title":"BindingContext Evaluation"},{"location":"xamarin-forms/binding-context-resolution/binding-context-evaluation/#binding-context-evaluation","text":"In Xamarin.Forms, all views have the property BindingContext; this specifies the object that a view should data-bind with.

Unfortunately, it is too expensive to scan the solution to match view models to pages; the scan takes anywhere between 10's to 100's of milliseconds in a moderately sized solution. Therefore, for efficiency reasons, you need to use an MFractor configuration to enable cross-project MVVM resolution. To make MFractor use View Models in a project separate to your views, you'll need to create an MFractor config for each project. In the project that contains your views, create a file named app.mfc.xml with the following content: ?xml version= 1.0 encoding= UTF-8 ? mfractor configure id= com.mfractor.configuration.forms.mvvm_resolution property name= ViewModelsProjectName value= TODO: Insert the name of your view models project as it appears in the solution explorer / /configure /mfractor In the project that contains your view models, create a file named app.mfc.xml with the following content: ?xml version= 1.0 encoding= UTF-8 ? mfractor configure id= com.mfractor.configuration.forms.mvvm_resolution property name= ViewsProjectName value= TODO: Insert the name of your views project as it appears in the solution explorer / /configure /mfractor","title":"Cross Project Binding Context Resolution"},{"location":"xamarin-forms/binding-context-resolution/cross-project-binding-context-resolution/#cross-project-binding-context-resolution","text":"If your views and view models are in separate projects and you'd like to use implicit MVVM resolution, you'll need to give MFractor a nudge in the right direction. Unfortunately, it is too expensive to scan the solution to match view models to pages; the scan takes anywhere between 10's to 100's of milliseconds in a moderately sized solution. Therefore, for efficiency reasons, you need to use an MFractor configuration to enable cross-project MVVM resolution.

MFractor will attempt to infer the BindingContext for a data templates view by resolving the ItemsSource property on the wrapping view. Consider the following code: ListView ItemsSource= {Binding Contacts} ListView.ItemTemplate DataTemplate TextCell Text= {Binding DisplayName} / /DataTemplate /ListView.ItemTemplate /ListView The inner DataTemplate has a TextCell where the Text property is provided by the binding expression {Binding DisplayName}. To analyse this expression, MFractor requires a binding context; MFractor will walk out to the encapsulating view (ListView), locate the ItemsSource property and evaluate the expression.

So, what is a binding context? When using the Model-View-ViewModel architecture pattern, views use a Binding Context to display and transfer data between the application logic layer and the view layer with minimal dependencies.
