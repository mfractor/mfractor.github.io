Initially, the amount of options that are exposed will be limited but over time I will drastically increase the flexibility of MFractors code generation engine.\n\n\nIf you wish to have a piece of code generation customizable, please submit a feature request at \nMFractor Feedback\n.\n\n\nConfiguration Basics\n\n\nConceptually, MFractor has \nConfigurables\n, extensible features that expose properties that can be edited by a configuration file. \nConfigurables\n can be C# code actions, XML analysers, XAML code generators and much more.\n\n\nWhen browsing this website, you may notice that parts of the site are tagged as \nAutogenerated\n. Several parts of this documentation site are autogenerated from the configurable features inside MFractor, grouping them by behaviour and categories.\n\n\nLet's look at the 3 main configurable feature types:\n\n\nC ode Actions\n\n\nCode actions are features exposed through the IDE context menu (accessed via \nRight CLick\n or \nAlt+Return\n) that fix code issues and organise, refactor and generate source code.\n\n\nCode Analysis\n\n\nCode analysis features are linters that inspect for problems in your source code. Typically, code analysers are \nnot\n configurable.\n\n\nCode Generation\n\n\nCode generators create source code (such as C# or XAML); they isolate the creation of a common piece of code into a single, reusable unit.\n\n\nCode generators are only ever directly used by code actions; they are not exposed through the IDE.\n\n\nConfiguration Files\n\n\nMFractor configuration files are XML based and end with the extension \n.mfc.xml\n; a configuration file can be named anything and be placed in any directory if a project as long as it ends in the extension \n.mfc.xml\n.\n\n\nHow does it work? Let's consider the following configuration file:\n\n\nconfig.mfc.xml\n\n\n?xml version=\n1.0\n encoding=\nUTF-8\n ?\n\n\nmfractor\n\n        \n!-- Change the behaviour of the Implement View Model code action --\n\n    \nconfigure id=\ncom.mfractor.code_action.forms.implement_view_model\n\n            \nproperty name=\nBaseClass\n value=\nMyNamespace.ViewModels.ViewModelBase\n/\n\n    \n/configure\n\n\n/mfractor\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's examine each of the each element in the above configuration in depth:\n\n\n\n\nWe open a configuration file with the \nmfractor\n tag; this is ceremony to denote to MFractor this is a config file.\n\n\nWe \ntarget\n a configurable by using the \nconfigure\n element:\n\n\nThe \nid\n attribute specifies the unique identifier of the configurable we wish to modify. An id could refer a code action, a code generator or an analysis routine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe \nmodify\n a property using the \nproperty\n element:\n\n\nThe \nname\n attribute specifies the configurable property we wish to edit.\n\n\nThe \nvalue\n attribute specifies the value we wish to set the property to.\n\n\nWe \ngroup\n configurations within the \ncollection name=\"CollectionName\"\n element. These groups are hard coded into the product itself and relate to how the code actions, code generation and code analysis documentation folders are structured in this site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration Identifiers\n\n\nEvery element inside MFractor that can be configured has it's own unique \nconfiguration identifier\n. This a java-style, package based string that indicates the software, element type and element name inside the name.\n\n\nFor example, the Xamarin.Forms \nImplement View Model\n code action has the configuration identifier \ncom.mfractor.code_actions.forms.implement_view_model\n. A features id is located below the heading inside the documentation:\n\n\n\n\nIf we wanted to change the behaviour of the \nImplement View Model\n code action, we add a \nconfigure\n element into our \n.mfc.xml\n and target the identifier \ncom.mfractor.code_action.forms.implement_view_model\n:\n\n\nconfigure id=\ncom.mfractor.code_action.forms.implement_view_model\n\n\n/configure\n\n\n\n\n\nInside the \nconfigure\n element we can now specify multiple \nproperty\n tags to change properties inside the configurable.\n\n\nConfigurable Properties\n\n\nAfter targeting a configurable, we can use \nConfigurable Properties\n to change the behaviour of that feature.\n\n\nConfigurable properties are settings that can be edited on a configurable through the use of the \nproperty\n tag.\n\n\nWe place a \nproperty\n tag inside a \nconfigure\n tag; we can then target the property name using the \nname\n attribute and apply a new value using the \nvalue\n attribute.\n\n\nFor example, we can change the output folder for new ViewModels by using a \nproperty\n setter on the \nViewModelsFolder\n property:\n\n\nconfigure id=\ncom.mfractor.code_action.forms.implement_view_model\n\n    \nproperty name=\nViewModelsFolder\n value=\nPath/To/ViewModelsFolder\n/\n\n\n/configure\n\n\n\n\n\nCode Generation Dependencies\n\n\nOften multiple code actions need to generate the same source; rather than configuring each code action separately each code action reuses a common \ncode generator\n. A code generator is a configurable that encapsulates the logic needed to generate a specific piece of code.\n\n\nFor example, both the \nImplement View Model\n and \nGenerate Missing Command\n use the \nGenerate ICommand Implementation\n code generator; this allows us to set the ICommand type once and have the behaviour propagate through all code-actions that need to generate an ICommand implementation.\n\n\nThis documentation site lists the code-generaton dependencies",

This is accomplished through \ndata binding\n; properties on a view are bound to properties on a backing object through binding mechanisms allowing two-way data transfer between the UI and application logic. For a full tutorial on Mvvm architecture, please Microsofts \nThe Mvvm Pattern\n article.\n\n\nWhen working with Xaml, we can specify a binding context to activate binding expression analysis and a variety of BindingContext specific refactorings.\n\n\nWe can specify a binding context \nexplicitly\n via in inline Xaml expression or \nimplicitly\n through the use of common MVVM naming conventions.\n\n\nImplicit Binding Context Resolution\n\n\nMFractor will attempt to infer the relationship between your view models and xaml views via \nimplicit binding context resolution\n. This is done by looking for classes and Xaml views that share a common naming convention.\n\n\nLet's consider the following files:\n\n\n\n\nLoginPage.xaml\n - The xaml view.\n\n\nLoginPage.xaml.cs\n - The code behind for the xaml view.\n\n\nLoginViewModel\n - The a C# class that is the view model for the LoginPage view.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause these pages share the prefix \nLogin\n and each has a distinct file extension or suffix, MFractor assumes the following relationships:\n\n\n\n\nThe \n.xaml\n extension denotes that \nLoginPage.xaml\n is a xaml view.\n\n\nThe \n.xaml.cs\n extension and the \nLoginPage\n component denotes that \nLoginPage.xaml.cs\n is the code behind implementation \nLoginPage\n view.\n\n\nThe \nViewModel\n suffix implies that \nLoginViewModel\n is a view model. When \nViewModel\n is removed from \nLoginViewModel\n and \nPage\n is removed from \nLoginPage\n, the \nLogin\n component implies that the \nLoginViewModel\n is related to the \nLoginPage\n xaml view and it's code behind file.\n\n\n\n\nMFractor uses these common naming conventions of Page.xaml, Page.xaml.cs and ViewModel to decide that \nLoginViewModel\n will probably be the BindingContext for \nLoginPage\n. The \nPage\n \n-\n \nViewModel\n naming convention is used by several popular MVVM frameworks such as Prism and FreshMVVM.\n\n\nThe following suffixes are supported for Xaml views:\n\n\n\n\nPage\n: EG LoginPage.xaml \n-\n LoginViewModel\n\n\nView\n: EG LoginView.xaml \n-\n LoginViewModel\n\n\n\n\nExplicit Binding Context Resolution\n\n\nIn Xamarin.Forms, all views have the property \nBindingContext\n; this specifies the object that a view should data-bind with. When coding with Xaml, we can use the \nx:Static\n markup extension to reference a static C# property and explicitly provide an instance of a C# class as the binding context:\n\n\n \nEntry BindingContext=\n{x:Static local:MyStaticClass.MyStaticProperty}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is known as the \nView Model Locator Pattern\n. We implement a static class named \nViewModelLocator\n and use a static, readonly property to return an instance of the object we want our Xaml view to data-bind with. Historically the \nView Model Locator Pattern\n has been used to provide design time data to the Xamarin.Forms Xaml previewer. For a deeper insight into this pattern, read James Montemagnos excellent \nView Model Locator\n article.\n\n\nFor example, given a Xaml page named \nLoginPage\n, we can explicitly provide an instance of \nLoginViewModel\n as the binding context like so:\n\n\nViewModelLocator.cs\n\n\npublic namespace MyApp\n{\n  public static class ViewModelLocator\n  {\n      public static readonly LoginViewModel LoginViewModel = new LoginViewModel();\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nLoginPage.xaml\n\n\nContentPage\n  xmlns:local=\nclr-namespace:MyApp;assembly=MyApp\n\n  BindingContext=\n{x:Static local:ViewModelLocator.LoginViewModel}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen MFractor begins analysis on LoginPage.xaml it will check if any \nBindingContext\n properties have been assigned to. As the root \nContentPage\n assigns a binding context, it will inspect the value component of the \nBindingContext\n attribute, check if it is a Xaml expression and then evaluate it for the return type.\n\n\nFor the \n{x:Static local:ViewModelLocator.LoginViewModel}\n expression, MFractor will resolve the \nViewModelLocator\n class in the \nlocal\n namespace and then grab the C# type of the \nLoginViewModel\n property. This informs MFractor that the page will be bound to a \nLoginViewModel\n instance and therefore to analyse all \nBinding\n expressions against the \nLoginViewModel\n type.\n\n\nExplicit binding context resolution will also work when referencing another element using \nx:Reference\n expressions. For example, we can bind the on/off state of a switch to the visibility of a text label like so:\n\n\n  \nSwitch x:Name=\nmySwitch\n /\n\n  \nLabel BindingContext=\n{x:Reference mySwitch}\n IsVisible=\n{Binding IsToggled}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen MFractor analyses the \n{Binding IsToggled}\n expression, it will evaluate the \n{x:Reference mySwitch}\n expression and use the type of mySwitch as the BindingContext (Xamarin.Forms.Switch).\n\n\nExplicit binding context resolution will \nalways\n override implicit binding context resolution. If your xaml views are named using the conventions listed above but your page or a view explicitly assigns the \nBindingContext\n property then MFractor will use the \nBindingContext\n return type instead of the implicit Mvvm relationship.\n\n\nData Template Binding Context Resolution\n\n\nData templates are used to provide a nested Xaml view to a view that displays many occurances of that view. For example, a ListView uses a \nDataTemplate\n to specify the view appearance of each instance provided through the \nItemsSource\n property.\n\n\nMFractor will attempt to infer the BindingContext for a data templates view by resolving the \nItemsSource\n property on the wrapping view.\n\n\nConsider the following code:\n\n\n  \nListView ItemsSource=\n{Binding Contacts}\n\n      \nListView.ItemTemplate\n\n        \nDataTemplate\n\n          \nTextCell Text=\n{Binding DisplayName}\n /\n\n        \n/DataTemplate\n\n      \n/ListView.ItemTemplate\n\n  \n/ListView\n\n\n\n\n\nThe inner \nDataTemplate\n has a \nTextCell\n where the \nText\n property is provided by the binding expression \n{Binding DisplayName}\n. To analyse this expression, MFractor requires a binding context; MFractor will walk out to the encapsulating view (ListView), locate the \nItemsSource\n property and evaluate the expression.\n\n\nWhen the return type is an \nIEnumerable\n or array, MFractor unwraps the generic or array and grabs the inner type. This provides the binding context type for the binding expressions used within the data template.\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nIn summary, we've learnt that MFractor will use the binding context to power the Xaml analyser and navigation improvements.\n\n\n\n\nBinding expressions require a binding context to be analysed.\n\n\nWe can explicitly specify a binding context by assigning the \nBindingContext\n property of any Xaml element.\n\n\nWhen we name our code files using the Page.xaml, Page.xaml.cs and ViewModel convention, MFractor will assume an implicit MVVM relationship.\n\n\nData templates use the return type of the wrapping views \nItemSource\n property.",

This is a Xamarin.Forms API that implements the \nIMarkupExtension interface\n; it reflects changes from the binding context to the view and vice-versa.\n\n\nWe use the binding markup extension syntax in our Xaml views:\n\n\nLoginPage.xaml.cs\n\n\nEntry Text=\n{Binding Username}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nLoginViewModel.cs\n\n\npublic class LoginViewModel\n{\n  public string Username { get; set; }\n}\n\n\n\n\nIn the above example, \n{Binding Username}\n points to a public property on the \nLogingPage\ns binding context, the \nLoginViewModel\n. When the user enters text, changes are automatically applied into the \nUsername\n property.\n\n\nBut what if we introduced a new \nEntry\n bound to \nPassword\n, a property that doesn't exist on the \nLoginViewModel\n:\n\n\nLoginPage.xaml.cs\n\n\nEntry Text=\n{Binding Username}\n/\n\n\nEntry Text=\n{Binding Password}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nProvided we have configured the views binding context correctly, the \nXaml analyser\n recognises this is a runtime bug and marks it:\n\n\n\n\nMFractor encourages a \nXaml first\n workflow; you write out bindings in Xaml and then generate the implementation on the view model.\n\n\nThis is a big change to existing workflows. Previously, we coded these properties by hand and wire them up manually in the Xaml; an approach both time-consuming and error prone. You have to remember property names, property types, control types and then you need to write this all out by hand!\n\n\nUsing binding generation we can \nliterally\n eliminate minutes of work and hundreds of keystrokes in a few clicks.\n\n\nMFractor provides the following shortcuts to implement our bound properties:\n\n\n\n\nFix Missing Binding\n: A code issue fix that generates a single binding property onto the view model.\n\n\nImplement View Model\n: A refactoring action that collects \nall\n missing bindings and generates them in bulk on the view model.\n\n\n\n\nLet's examine these two methods of implementing missing properties using MFractor.\n\n\nIssue Fixing on Missing Bindings\n\n\nWhen MFractor detects that a property in a binding expression doesn't exist on the binding context, it adds a code issue at the missing bindings location.\n\n\nTo action the code isxue fix, we right click on the issue (underlined in yellow), navigate to \nFix\n and then select \nGenerate a property...\n.\n\n\n\n\nWe have two options available when generating a property:\n\n\nGenerate a property named XXX in XXX\n creates a new public property with a public \nget\n and \nset\n accessor:\n\n\npublic string Password { get; set; }\n\n\n\n\nGenerate a property named XXX in XXX with backing fields\n creates a new public property with a public \nget\n and \nset\n accessor that sets or gets a backing field:\n\n\nprivate string _password;\npublic string Password\n{\n  get\n  {\n    return _password;\n  }\n  set\n  {\n    _password = value;\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe default getter / setter fix is most useful when:\n\n\n\n\nWe want a plain old property with no backing logic.\n\n\nWe are using Fody's \nImplementPropertyChanged\n attribute on our ViewModel to automatically add INotifyPropertyChanged behaviour.\n\n\n\n\nThe backing field fix is most useful when:\n\n\n\n\nWe want backing logic that occurs when our property changes.\n\n\nWe occasionally want to manipulate the properties backing field without changes propagating to the UI.\n\n\n\n\nThe Implement ViewModel Refactoring\n\n\nAnother way to generate properties for a view model is to use the \nImplement View Model\n refactoring. This shortcut collects \nall\n missing binding expressions (excluding bindings inside DataTemplates) and generates them in bulk onto the binding context.\n\n\nWe can access this short cut by right clicking anywhere in a Xaml file, navigating to \nGenerate\n and then selecting the \nImplement View Model\n action:\n\n\n\n\nYou'll notice that there are 2 actions:\n\n\n\n\nImplement View Model\n gathers all missing bindings in the xaml document and implements them all as public properties with a public \nget\n and \nset\n accessor.\n\n\nImplement View Model (Use Backing Fields)\n gathers all missing bindings in the xaml document and implements them all as public properties with a public \nget\n and \nset\n accessor that sets or gets a backing field.\n\n\n\n\nThere are often cases when a binding context isn't specified \nexplicitly \n and can't be inferred \nimplicitly\n. A common example of this is that you have just started to build a Xaml view and haven't yet got around to building the corresponding view model.\n\n\nThe \nImplement View Model\n action can also generate a view model class for the Xaml view if one is not already defined. Using Mvvm naming conventions, MFractor generates a view model class for your xaml view under the \nMyDefaultNamespace.ViewModels\n namespace.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\nLoginPage.xaml.cs\n\n\nEntry Text=\n{Binding Username}\n/\n\n\nEntry Text=\n{Binding Password}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen creating the view model class, MFractor removes the \nPage\n or \nView\n suffix from the view name and then attaches \nViewModel\n to the end of the resulting name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove the \nPage\n or \nView\n suffix: LoginPage -\n Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttach the \nViewModel\n suffix: Login -\n LoginViewModel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerate a new class named \nLoginViewModel\n under the namespace \nMyDefaultNamespace.ViewModels\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis would result in the following view model class file:\n\n\nLoginViewModel.cs\n\n\npublic namespace MyDefaultNamespace.ViewModels\n{\n  public class LoginViewModel\n  {\n    public string Username { get; set; }\n    public string Password { get; set; }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nIf you project references Fody's \nImplementPropertyChanged\n extension, the default getter / setter implementation will also annotate the result with the \n[ImplementPropertyChanged.PropertyChanged]\n attribute:\n\n\nLoginViewModel.cs\n\n\n[ImplementPropertyChanged.PropertyChanged]\npublic class LoginViewModel\n{\n}\n\n\n\n\nGenerating Commands Implementations\n\n\nWhen MFractor encounters a property that expects the \nSystem.Windows.Input.ICommand\n interface, it will generate a property returning a empty command implementation.\n\n\nFor example, we bind our login button to a \nLoginCommand\n property on our view model:\n\n\nButton Command=\n{Binding LoginCommand}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen MFractor generates the property for \nLoginCommand\n, it creates an empty command implementation:\n\n\npublic System.Windows.Input.ICommand LoginCommand\n{\n    get\n    {\n        return new Xamarin.Forms.Command(() =\n\n        {\n            throw new NotImplementedException();\n        }\n\n        );\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nBinding Generation And Value Converters\n\n\nWhen a binding expression uses a \nConverter\n, MFractor will attempt to resolve the input type of the referenced value converter and use that as the property type. We must have a value conversion attribute on the \nIValueConverter\n for MFractor to resolve the input type. Please read the \nValue Conversion Type-Safety\n tutorial to learn more.\n\n\nFor example, we add a login button that is only enabled when the user has their password entered:\n\n\nResourceDictionary\n\n    \nlocal:StringToBoolConverter x:Key=\nstringToBoolConverter\n /\n\n\n/ResourceDictionary\n\n\n\nButton IsEnabled=\n{Binding Password, Converter={StaticResource stringToBoolConverter}}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nProvided that \nstringToBoolConverter\n is annotated to accept string inputs and return a boolean output, MFractor can still generate \nPassword\n as a string even though \nIsEnabled\n is a boolean property.\n\n\nIf there is no value conversion information on the value converter, MFractor will default to \nSysten.Object\n as the type for our property:\n\n\npublic System.Object Password\n{\n  get; set;\n}\n\n\n\n\nLimitations\n\n\nThere are a some limitations in the \nImplement View Model\n refactoring:\n\n\n\n\nWhen a Xaml view has an item that uses a \nDataTemplate\n to declare an inline view, MFractor \nwill not\n gather the bindings inside the data template. A refactoring action to generate bindings for data templates will be coming in a future MFractor release.\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nBy building our apps using the \nXaml first\n mindset, we can leverage MFractor's binding generation to implement our view models quickly.\n\n\nIn this tutorial we learnt:\n\n\n\n\nWe can generate entire view models using the \nImplement View Model\n refactoring action.\n\n\nWe can generate single properties using code issue fixing.\n\n\nWe need a binding context to activate binding expression analysis and issue fixing.\n\n\nWhen a binding uses a value converter, MFractor use the correct type when the converter has a value conversion attribute.",

This shortcut collects  all  missing binding expressions (excluding bindings inside DataTemplates) and generates them in bulk onto the binding context.  We can access this short cut by right clicking anywhere in a Xaml file, navigating to  Generate  and then selecting the  Implement View Model  action:   You'll notice that there are 2 actions:   Implement View Model  gathers all missing bindings in the xaml document and implements them all as public properties with a public  get  and  set  accessor.  Implement View Model (Use Backing Fields)  gathers all missing bindings in the xaml document and implements them all as public properties with a public  get  and  set  accessor that sets or gets a backing field.   There are often cases when a binding context isn't specified  explicitly   and can't be inferred  implicitly . A common example of this is that you have just started to build a Xaml view and haven't yet got around to building the corresponding view model.  The  Implement View Model  action can also generate a view model class for the Xaml view if one is not already defined. Using Mvvm naming conventions, MFractor generates a view model class for your xaml view under the  MyDefaultNamespace.ViewModels  namespace.  For example:  LoginPage.xaml.cs  Entry Text= {Binding Username} /  Entry Text= {Binding Password} /   When creating the view model class, MFractor removes the  Page  or  View  suffix from the view name and then attaches  ViewModel  to the end of the resulting name.     Remove the  Page  or  View  suffix: LoginPage -  Login      Attach the  ViewModel  suffix: Login -  LoginViewModel      Generate a new class named  LoginViewModel  under the namespace  MyDefaultNamespace.ViewModels .     This would result in the following view model class file:  LoginViewModel.cs  public namespace MyDefaultNamespace.ViewModels\n{\n  public class LoginViewModel\n  {\n    public string Username { get; set; }\n    public string Password { get; set; }\n  }\n}  If you project references Fody's  ImplementPropertyChanged  extension, the default getter / setter implementation will also annotate the result with the  [ImplementPropertyChanged.PropertyChanged]  attribute:  LoginViewModel.cs  [ImplementPropertyChanged.PropertyChanged]\npublic class LoginViewModel\n{\n}",

But what if we had a screen with an email entry that needs to change color when the user enters a valid email?\n\n\nEnter the \nIValueConverter interface\n; value converters transform one data type to another.\n\n\nWe can expose a boolean \nIsEmailValid\n on our binding context, bind the \nTextColor\n field of the entry to the \nIsEmailValid\n property and use an \nIValueConverter\n that converts a \nTrue\n value to black and a \nFalse\n value to red.\n\n\nOur converter would look like this:\n\n\npublic class BoolToTextColorConverter : IValueConverter\n{\n    public object Convert(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)\n    {\n        return (bool)value ?

What\u2019s more, using go-to declaration on a C# resource symbol takes you to its integer id! It\u2019s tremendously frustrating and a massive time-waster.\n\n\nAnd this problem gets worse the bigger your project is; large Android applications can have dozens to hundreds of xml resources that need to be scanned each time a search takes place.\n\n\nMFractor addresses these navigation issues by overriding the default \u201cgo to declaration\u201d keyboard shortcuts when you are in the context of a resource expression.\n\n\nThese expressions come in 2 flavours:\n\n\n\n\nC#: Code expressions within C# that access the generated Resources class contained in the Resources.Designer.cs file. For instance; Resource.Layout.myLayout.\n\n\nXML: Code expressions within Android xml resources that point to another resource. For instance; @layout/myLayout.\n\n\n\n\nWhen MFractor detects the cursor is within one of these expressions, resource tooltips and go-to-declaration become active. This enables fast and efficient code navigation.\n\n\nThat is much faster than manual searching! Now lets go over each of these expression types.\n\n\nC# Resource Expressions\n\n\nFor C#, resource expressions are always resolved against the Resource.Designer.cs file that is generated alongside a project. This section assumes a basic familiarity of the Resource.Designer.cs file; if this is a new concept I suggested reading the \nAndroid Resource Basics\n page in Xamarins documentation.\n\n\nThe components of a supported resource expression are formatted like so:\n\n\n[Project Namespace].[Resource].[ResourceType].[ResourceName]\n\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\n\n\n[Project Namespace] is the project namespace that the Resources designer class resides. This component is either:\n\n\nImplicit: The encapsulating namespace is the same as the resource designers namespace or a using statement provides the resource designer class.\n\n\nExplicit: The expression explicitly uses the namespace that owns the resource class.\n\n\nResource is the constant Resource class that wraps the declarations of the ResourceType sub-classes.\n\n\nResourceType is the nested resource type class.\n\n\nResourceName is the name of the resource being referenced. MFractor will only trigger its behaviour when your caret or mouse cursor is over this component of the c# resource expression.\n\n\n\n\nAn example of a valid expression would be:\n\n\nResources.String.my_string;\n\n\n\n\nWhen your cursor is over the my_string component of this expression, MFractor will attempt to resolve a string resource named my_string.\n\n\nXml Resource Expressions\n\n\nXml resource expressions come in 3 different categories:\n\n\n\n\nReference expressions point directly to a resource. They begin with the \u2018@\u2019 character.\n\n\nDeclarative expressions declare a new resource. These are only used with ids. They begin with a \u2018@+\u2019 character sequence.\n\n\nTheme expression point to a component of the currently scoped theme. They begin with a \u2018?\u2019 character.\n\n\n\n\nReference and declarative expression are structured with the following syntax:\n\n\n@[+][PackageName:]resourceType/resourceName\n\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@[+] is the resource reference symbol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackageName is an optional component that points to the package the resource is within.\n\n\n\n\nresourceType is the resource type.\n\n\nresourceName is the name of the resource.\n\n\n\n\nAn example of this would be:\n\n\n@string/my_string\n\n\n\n\nWhen your cursor is any component of this expression, MFractor will attempt to resolve a pre-existing string resource named my_string.\n\n\nLastly, theme resource expressions point to a component of the current theme. These are structured with the following syntax:\n\n\n?[PackageName:][ResourceType/]themeItemName\n\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\n\n\nPackageName is the optional package name the theme component resides within.\n\n\nResourceType is the optional resource type of the theme component. This is typically inferred.\n\n\nthemeItemName the name of the theme item.\n\n\n\n\nGo To Resource Declaration\n\n\nFind All Resource Usages\n\n\nResource Tooltips\n\n\nImage Tooltips",

MFractor addresses these navigation issues by overriding the default \u201cgo to declaration\u201d keyboard shortcuts when you are in the context of a resource expression.  These expressions come in 2 flavours:   C#: Code expressions within C# that access the generated Resources class contained in the Resources.Designer.cs file. For instance; Resource.Layout.myLayout.  XML: Code expressions within Android xml resources that point to another resource. For instance; @layout/myLayout.   When MFractor detects the cursor is within one of these expressions, resource tooltips and go-to-declaration become active. This enables fast and efficient code navigation.  That is much faster than manual searching! Now lets go over each of these expression types.",

            "text": "For C#, resource expressions are always resolved against the Resource.Designer.cs file that is generated alongside a project. This section assumes a basic familiarity of the Resource.Designer.cs file; if this is a new concept I suggested reading the  Android Resource Basics  page in Xamarins documentation.  The components of a supported resource expression are formatted like so:  [Project Namespace].[Resource].[ResourceType].[ResourceName]  Where:   [Project Namespace] is the project namespace that the Resources designer class resides. This component is either:  Implicit: The encapsulating namespace is the same as the resource designers namespace or a using statement provides the resource designer class.  Explicit: The expression explicitly uses the namespace that owns the resource class.  Resource is the constant Resource class that wraps the declarations of the ResourceType sub-classes.  ResourceType is the nested resource type class.  ResourceName is the name of the resource being referenced. MFractor will only trigger its behaviour when your caret or mouse cursor is over this component of the c# resource expression.   An example of a valid expression would be:  Resources.String.my_string;  When your cursor is over the my_string component of this expression, MFractor will attempt to resolve a string resource named my_string.",

Declarative expressions declare a new resource. These are only used with ids. They begin with a \u2018@+\u2019 character sequence.  Theme expression point to a component of the currently scoped theme. They begin with a \u2018?\u2019 character.   Reference and declarative expression are structured with the following syntax:  @[+][PackageName:]resourceType/resourceName  Where:    @[+] is the resource reference symbol.    PackageName is an optional component that points to the package the resource is within.   resourceType is the resource type.  resourceName is the name of the resource.   An example of this would be:  @string/my_string  When your cursor is any component of this expression, MFractor will attempt to resolve a pre-existing string resource named my_string.  Lastly, theme resource expressions point to a component of the current theme. These are structured with the following syntax:  ?[PackageName:][ResourceType/]themeItemName  Where:   PackageName is the optional package name the theme component resides within.  ResourceType is the optional resource type of the theme component. This is typically inferred.  themeItemName the name of the theme item.",

If the value is an expression, MFractor will evaluate the expression and use the return type as the new properties type.\n\n\nIf the attributes value isn't an expression, MFractor will attempt to infer type based on the literal input. For example, an attribute value of \ntrue\n would trigger MFractor to output a boolean typed property. This behaviour can be disabled by configuring the \nTryInferUnknownTypes\n to false.\n\n\nConfigurable Properties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nType\n\n\nDefaults To\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTryInferUnknownTypes\n\n\nSystem.Boolean\n\n\nTrue\n\n\nShould MFractor attempt to guess the type for the new property based on it's value? EG: A value of \ntrue\n would cause the output type to be \nbool\n instead of \nSystem.Object\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefaultColorType\n\n\nSystem.String\n\n\n\"Xamarin.Forms.Color\"\n\n\nWhen attempting to infer the property type based on its value and MFractor decides it's a color, what is the color type MFractor should use?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefaultPropertyType\n\n\nSystem.String\n\n\n\"System.Object\"\n\n\nWhat is the default type for the new property if MFractor can't figure it out based on the attribute value?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefaultImageType\n\n\nSystem.String\n\n\n\"Xamarin.Forms.ImageSource\"\n\n\nWhen attempting to infer the property type based on its value and MFractor decides it's an image, what is the CLR type MFractor should use?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUses:\n\n\n\n\nGenerate Bindable Property\n\n\nView Model Property Generator\n\n\nGenerate Event Handler Declaration\n\n\n\n\nCreate Value Converter To Resolve Type Flow\n\n\nProfessional Only\n\n\nConfiguration Id: com.mfractor.code_fixes.xaml.create_resolving_value_converter\n\n\nFixes Code Issue:\n \nBinding Expression Return Type Mismatch\n\n\n\n\nUsing the input and output type for a value conversion path, this code fix creates a new value converter implementation for the input and output type and imports it into the views resource dictionary.\n\n\nConfigurable Properties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nType\n\n\nDefaults To\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefaultConverterNamespace\n\n\nSystem.String\n\n\n\"converters\"\n\n\nThe namespace name of the xmlns import statement for the newly created value converter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUses:\n\n\n\n\nGenerate IValueConverter Implementation\n\n\n\n\nCreate x:TypeArguments Attribute\n\n\nProfessional Only\n\n\nConfiguration Id: com.mfractor.code_fixes.xaml.create_type_arguments_attribute\n\n\nFixes Code Issue:\n \nGeneric Usage Is Missing x:TypeArguments\n\n\nGenerates an x:TypeArguments attribute, resolving the potential argument types if possible.\n\n\nEncapsulate Content Page Children With Grid\n\n\nProfessional Only\n\n\nConfiguration Id: com.mfractor.code_fixes.xaml.encapsulate_content_page_children_with_grid\n\n\nFixes Code Issue:\n \nContentPage Has Multiple Direct Children\n\n\nWhen a content page has multiple direct children, this fix merges them into a stacklayou.\n\n\nUses:\n\n\n\n\nGenerate Grid\n\n\n\n\nEncapsulate Content Page Children With StackLayout\n\n\nProfessional Only\n\n\nConfiguration Id: com.mfractor.code_fixes.xaml.encapsulate_content_page_children_with_stack_layout\n\n\nFixes Code Issue:\n \nContentPage Has Multiple Direct Children\n\n\nWhen a content page has multiple direct children, this fix merges them into a grid.\n\n\nConfigurable Properties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nType\n\n\nDefaults To\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefaultOrientation\n\n\nSystem.String\n\n\n\"\"\n\n\nWhat is the default orientation for the \nStackLayout\n that is created for this fix?

To include this control into our XAML, we need to add the following code into the root XAML node:\n\n\nxmlns:ffimage=\nclr-namespace:FFImageLoading.Forms;assembly=FFImageLoading.Forms\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's a few issues with this workflow:\n\n\n\n\nRemembering the \nclr-namespace: ... ;assembly= ...\n syntax is hard!\n\n\nRemembering what namespace and assembly a control is in is hard!\n\n\n\n\nTherefore the \nImport Namespace And Assembly For Unresolved XAML Node\n code fix is very useful because it resolves these for you!\n\n\nThe code action will search all assemblies that the project references for classes that match the name of the XAML node. It will then suggest the creation of an \nxmlns=...\n import statement to resovle that missing class:\n\n\nBefore\n\n \n?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\n\n\nContentPage xmlns=\"http://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms\"\n    x:Class=\"MyXamarinFormsApp.MainPage\" \n\n    \nffimage:CachedImage/\n \n-- The ffimage namespace doesn't exist!\n\n/ContentPage\n\n\nAfter\n\n \n?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\n\n\nContentPage xmlns=\"http://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms\"\n    x:Class=\"MyXamarinFormsApp.MainPage\"\n    xmlns:ffimage=\"clr-namespace:FFImageLoading.Forms;assembly=FFImageLoading.Forms\" \n \n-- The ffimage is now resolved\n    \nffimage:CachedImage/\n\n\n/ContentPage\n\n\nImport Value Converter For Binding Type Flow\n\n\nProfessional Only\n\n\nConfiguration Id: com.mfractor.code_fixes.xaml.import_resolving_value_converter\n\n\nFixes Code Issue:\n \nBinding Expression Return Type Mismatch\n\n\nInspects for IValueConverter implementations within the project and it's references that match the value conversion flow for this binding type mismatch.

For this fix to activate, the following conditions must be fulfilled:   The attribute used on a XAML node does not exist on the .NET class for that node.  The class referenced by the XAML node is within the users source code.   Consider the following code example:  MyCustomControl.cs  public class MyCustomControl : Xamarin.Forms.View\n{\n}  MyPage.xaml  ContentPage xmlns= http://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms \n    xmlns:x= http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml \n    x:Class= MyApp.MainPage \n     MyCustomControl OnTappedMessage= The custom control was tapped! /  /ContentPage   The attribute  OnTappedMessage  is attempting to reference a member that does not exist inside  MyCustomControl ; a developer can use this code action to generate that missing member:  MyCustomControl.cs  public class MyCustomControl : Xamarin.Forms.View\n{\n    public string OnTappedMessage { get; set; }\n}  When the class derives from  Xamarin.Forms.View , this code action can be used to generate a bindable property implementation:   The code action will attempt to resolve the new properties type by inspecting the value of the source attribute. If the value is an expression, MFractor will evaluate the expression and use the return type as the new properties type.  If the attributes value isn't an expression, MFractor will attempt to infer type based on the literal input. For example, an attribute value of  true  would trigger MFractor to output a boolean typed property. This behaviour can be disabled by configuring the  TryInferUnknownTypes  to false.",

For example, consider we wanted to use FFImageLoadings  CachedImage  control like so:       ffimage:CachedImage/   This control lives inside the  FFImageLoading.Forms  namespace in the  FFImageLoading.Forms  assembly. To include this control into our XAML, we need to add the following code into the root XAML node:  xmlns:ffimage= clr-namespace:FFImageLoading.Forms;assembly=FFImageLoading.Forms   There's a few issues with this workflow:   Remembering the  clr-namespace: ... ;assembly= ...  syntax is hard!  Remembering what namespace and assembly a control is in is hard!   Therefore the  Import Namespace And Assembly For Unresolved XAML Node  code fix is very useful because it resolves these for you!

Unfortunately this has a nasty edgecase; \nApplication\n subclasses \nmust\n manually implement the peer connection constructor otherwise the Xamarin.Android runtime cannot instantiate it!\n\n\nConsider the following application subclass:\n\n\nMyApplication.cs\n\n\n[Application(Name=\ncom.companyname.myandroidapp.MyApplication\n, Icon=\n@mipmap/icon\n, Label=\n@string/app_name\n)]\npublic class MyApplication : Application\n{\n    public override void OnCreate()\n    {\n        base.OnCreate();\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nAt a glance, this seems perfectly reasonable. However, when the \nOnCreate\n method is called by the Xamarin.Android runtime, it generates a \nSystem.NotSupportedException\n when the Java counterpart for the managed \nApplication\n class cannot be bound:\n\n\n\n\nThis can be fixed by implementing the peer connection constructor for the \nApplication\n class:\n\n\nMyApplication.cs\n\n\n[Application(Name = \ncom.companyname.myandroidapp.MyApplication\n, Icon = \n@mipmap/icon\n, Label = \n@string/app_name\n)]\npublic class MyApplication : Application\n{\n    public MyApplication(System.IntPtr javaReference, Android.Runtime.JniHandleOwnership transfer)\n        : base(javaReference, transfer)\n    {\n    }\n\n    public override void OnCreate()\n    {\n        base.OnCreate();\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nTo quickly fix this code issue, you can use the \nimplement base class constructors code action\n.\n\n\nRefer To:\n\n\n\n\nHow to register my own Application subclass in Xamarin.Android?\n\n\nWhat is the recipe to have a working Application-derived class?\n\n\n\n\nCheck Android.Content.Res.Resources Usages\n\n\nWhen using the Android.Content.Res.Resources class, all Get* expressions expect the correct resource type identifier. For example, when using Resource.GetString(), a resource identifier of Resources.String.myString is expected.

This code analyser validates that the correct resource type is being provided to the API call.\n\n\nCheck Views Exist In Layout\n\n\nWhen connecting Android layouts (\naxml\n files located under \nResources/Layout\n), developers pull views out of their bound layout with the \nFindViewById\n method.\n\n\nTake this example layout:\n\n\nMain.axml\n\n\nLinearLayout\n\n    \nButton android:id=\n+@id/mainButton\n/\n\n\n/LinearLayout\n\n\n\n\n\nMyActivity.cs\n\n\npublic class MyActivity : Activity\n{\n    public void OnCreate()\n    {\n        SetContentView(Resource.Layout.Main);\n        var button = FindViewById\nButton\n(Resource.Id.mainButton);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe developer is retrieving the \nmainButton\n from the \nMain.axml\n layout that was bound using the \nSetContentView(Resource.Layout.Main)\n invocation.\n\n\nIn large scale applications, as the amount of layouts grows, it becomes very easy to accidentally retrieve the wrong button from the layout.\n\n\nSay another layout defined \nsecondaryButton\n... Consider the following:\n\n\nMyActivity.cs\n\n\npublic class MyActivity : Activity\n{\n    public void OnCreate()\n    {\n        SetContentView(Resource.Layout.Main);\n        var button = FindViewById\nButton\n(Resource.Id.secondaryButton);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe developer is accidentally pulling out the \nsecondaryButton\n id from \nMain.axml\n but \nMain.axml\n defines \nmainButton\n; this will cause a runtime exception when the \nMainActivity\n is created.\n\n\nMFractor provides the \nMFractor.Annotations\n library that lets developers declare their layout uses for a class, enabling MFractor to inspect \nFindViewById\n calls and check that the \nResource.Id\n provided exists in a particular layout.\n\n\nMyActivity.cs\n\n\n[MFractor.Annotations.Android.UsesLayout(Resource.Layout.Main)]\npublic class MyActivity : Activity\n{\n    // ...\n}\n\n\n\n\nMFractor will look for a \nsecondaryButton\n declaration in all configurations of \nMain.axml\n and provide a code warning if it cannot be found:\n\n\n\n\nClass Derives From IJavaObject\n\n\nOften when creating new classes in a Xamarin.Android codebase developers will need a new class to be usable between Java and C#. Xamarin.Android provides the IJavaObject interface to expose a class to Java. Instead of directly inheriting from the IJavaObject interface, a developer should instead inherit from Java.Lang.Object which implements the required interface members.\n\n\nIncorrect Activity Creation\n\n\nThis analyser detects when a developer is instantiating an Android activity or activity subclass directly using a new expression. Activities should only ever be created through the operating system; creating them through a new expression leaves them in an invalid state.\n\n\nValidate Cheeseknife Attributes\n\n\nThis analyser inspect usages of attributes from the Cheeseknife view injection library; it validates that the Resource.Id.* exists in the layout provided into an MFractor.Annotations UsesLayout attribute.\n\n\nVerify Toast Is Shown\n\n\nSometimes when a Toast is created via MakeText, the Show method is accidently omitted. This analysis routine looks for invocations of Toast.MakeText() that don't then invoke the Show() method on the toast object in the same expression. If the MakeText() result is assigned into a variable or passed as a method argument then this check is skipped.\n\n\nWarn Of Static Context References\n\n\nThis analyser inspects static variable declarations within classes and checks if the type derives from Android.Content.Context.

Unfortunately this has a nasty edgecase;  Application  subclasses  must  manually implement the peer connection constructor otherwise the Xamarin.Android runtime cannot instantiate it!  Consider the following application subclass:  MyApplication.cs  [Application(Name= com.companyname.myandroidapp.MyApplication , Icon= @mipmap/icon , Label= @string/app_name )]\npublic class MyApplication : Application\n{\n    public override void OnCreate()\n    {\n        base.OnCreate();\n    }\n}  At a glance, this seems perfectly reasonable. However, when the  OnCreate  method is called by the Xamarin.Android runtime, it generates a  System.NotSupportedException  when the Java counterpart for the managed  Application  class cannot be bound:   This can be fixed by implementing the peer connection constructor for the  Application  class:  MyApplication.cs  [Application(Name =  com.companyname.myandroidapp.MyApplication , Icon =  @mipmap/icon , Label =  @string/app_name )]\npublic class MyApplication : Application\n{\n    public MyApplication(System.IntPtr javaReference, Android.Runtime.JniHandleOwnership transfer)\n        : base(javaReference, transfer)\n    {\n    }\n\n    public override void OnCreate()\n    {\n        base.OnCreate();\n    }\n}  To quickly fix this code issue, you can use the  implement base class constructors code action .

EG: \nResource.Layout.myLayout\n.\n\n\nFixed: Image tooltips now work in shared projects.\n\n\nFixed: Image tooltips now work when the image source is referring to a nested image under a folder. EG: \"Icons/logo.png\" inside the iOS Resources folder.\n\n\nFixed: Using the \nListView CachingStrategy\n property in XAML no longer generates an unknown property warning.\n\n\nFixed: Multiple potential null access that would cause the XAML analyser to fail.\n\n\nFixed: When using \nGo-To XAML symbol\n on a class with a XAML view and code-behind, don't include the auto-generated designer class as an option and jump straight to the code-behind.\n\n\nFixed: When using \nGo-To Code Behind Class\n, don't include the auto-generated designer class as an option and jump straight to the code-behind.",

Reduced memory consumption across the entire product.  The following code analysers have been removed:  Detect when an abstract class was used in XAML. This caused false errors.  Detect when the root XAML node has an x:Name declaration; it's likely the developer wants to reference the root element inside an  x:Reference  markup extension.

This action is not available if the attribute value is an expression or the attribute does not have a corresponding bindable property.\n\n\nOrganise Refactorings:\n\n\nThe \nCollapse Xaml Attributes\n refactoring will collapse all xaml attributes onto the same line as the parent xaml node.\n\n\nThe \nExpand Xaml Attributes\n refactoring will expand all xaml attributes onto separate lines.\n\n\nThe \nSort Xaml Attributes\n refactoring will sort the attributes for a xaml node by namespace and name.\n\n\nThe \nExpand Node\n refactoring takes a self-closing xaml node and generate a closing tag for it.\n\n\nThe \nCollapse Node\n refactoring takes a xaml node with no children and a closing tag and removes the closing tag to make the node self-closing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Code Generators\n\n\nRight click on an xaml node that inherits from \nXamarin.Forms.VisualElement\n or \nXamarin.Forms.Application\n and select \nAdd Resource Dictionary\n to generate a resource dictionary for that element.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Xaml Analysers\n\n\nDetect when an \nx:Name\n code-behind field declaration is empty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnhancements\n\n\n\n\nThis release targets Visual Studio Mac v6.1.5\n\n\nThe \nImplement View Model\n refactoring has been moved from the \nRefactor\n menu to \nGenerate\n.\n\n\nHover over a xaml attribute property that's a \nSystem.Drawing.Color\n or a \nXamarin.Forms.Color\n to see the color value inside the tooltip.\n\n\nThe Android SDK meta-data has been removed from MFractor.mpack; you can download and update the sdk meta-data through the \nHelp\n -\n \nMFractor\n -\n \nInstall Android SDK Meta-Data\n menu item.\n\n\n\n\nBug Fixes\n\n\n\n\nCorrectly validate the type provided to x:TypeArguments; there was a bug in the type checking algorithm.\n\n\nDon't allow the 'Simplify' refactoring to run against expressions.\n\n\nFix multiple type conversion checking bugs in the ValueConversion attribute validation.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Notes - v2.7.0\n\n\n8th January 2017\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nThis is a summary of the changes introduced in v2.7.0 of MFractor for Visual Studio Mac.\n\n\nThis release adds the ability implement entire view models, introduces a dozen xaml analysers and fixes many bugs.\n\n\nI recommend taking a moment to read these tutorials:\n\n\n\n\nImplementing View Models\n: Learn implement entire view models using the \nImplement View Model\n refactoring.\n\n\nValue Converter Type Safety\n: Learn to annotate \nIValueConverter\ns with value conversion attributes for \nConverter\n expression type-safety.\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing View Model Generation\n\n\nYou already love being able to generate bindings but I've taken it to the next level this release \ud83d\udcaa\n\n\n\n\nGot a heap of unimplemented bindings? Right click anywhere in your Xaml document and select \nRefactor\n -\n \nImplement View Model\n.\n\n\nMFractor will collect all the missing bindings and then generate a new class with \nall\n of those properties into a namespace named \nMyDefaultNamespace.ViewModels\n.\n\n\nDoes the view model already exist? Then MFractor simply inserts the missing bindings into the existing view model.\n\n\nI think it'll save you enough time during the week that you may just get to Friday beers a few hours early \ud83c\udf7b\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\n\nBy right clicking anywhere in a Xaml document, implement all missing bindings as a new or into an existing view model:\n\n\nImplement view model properties with a getter and setter.\n\n\nImplement view model properties with a backing field.\n\n\nBound properties that return \nICommand\n will have an empty \nXamarin.Forms.Command\n instance generated.\n\n\nWhen MFractor encounters binding expressions that use a \nConverter\n, it inspects the converter for a \nValueConversion\n attribute to deduce the input typed required. If it can't resolve the converter or the converter does not have value conversion information, it will default to using \nSystem.Object\n.\n\n\nWhen implementing a new view model with getter and setters, MFractor will inspect for references to Fody's \nImplementPropertyChanged\n and annotate the new class with it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Xaml Analysers:\n\n\nValidate that elements declared inside a resource dictionary have an x:Key.\n\n\nValidate that elements declared inside a resource dictionary have a unique x:Key value.\n\n\nDetect when an x:TypeArguments is used on a non-generic type and warn of incorrect usage.\n\n\nDetect when a property setter node (\nMyClass.MyProperty/\n) references a non-existent member on the parent class.\n\n\nDetect when a property setter attribute is empty.\n\n\nDetect when an undefined static resource is referenced by a \nStaticResource\n expression.\n\n\nDetect when the value returned by a \nStaticResource\n expression causes a type mismatch.\n\n\nDetect when an unknown type is being provided to a \nx:TypeArguments\n attribute.\n\n\nValidate that \nOnIdiom\n elements return the correct type for the outer property setter.\n\n\nValidate that \nOnPlatform\n elements return the correct type for the outer property setter.\n\n\nDetect when a developer has misused a property setter inside another xaml element. For example, \nOnIdiom.Phone\n doesn't make any sense when wrapped by the outer element \nOnPlatform\n.\n\n\nDetect when an incorrect input type is provided to a \nConverter\n. The value converter must have a \nValueConversion\n attribute for this to trigger.\n\n\nDetect when an incorrect output type is returned by a \nConverter\n expression. The value converter must have a \nValueConversion\n attribute for this to trigger.\n\n\nDetect when multiple occurrences of the same automation ID exists within a Xaml document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Xaml Fixes:\n\n\nGenerate missing resource dictionary keys.\n\n\nAuto-correct misspelt \nStaticResource\n references.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Simplify Refactorings:\n\n\nAttributes that use a static instance to initialize the property (eg \nVerticalOptions=\"LayoutOptions.CentreAndExpand\"\n) can now be simplified to just the instance name (eg \nVerticalOptions=\"CentreAndExpand\"\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnhancements\n\n\n\n\nThis release targets Visual Studio Mac v6.1.3\n\n\nThe \nAbout MFractor\n dialog now contains a button to copy version and IDE information into the clipboard for bug reports. See \nSupport - Filing A Bug Report\n for more information on filing a bug report.\n\n\nThis release introduces the framework for an Xml and Xaml refactoring engine. Over time, I'll be adding Xml and Xaml refactoring operations to make code cleanup a breeze.\n\n\nAnnotating value converters with a \nValueConversion(typeof(InputType), typeof(OutputType))\n attribute will trigger the conversion information to render into tooltip. See \nFormsCommunityToolkit.Converters\n for examples.\n\n\n\n\nBug Fixes\n\n\n\n\nSometimes the Xaml document analyser would fail to load and bring down the Xaml editor. This has been fixed.\n\n\nThe View \n - \n Code Behind navigation shortcuts would break when an AST parse was in progress. View \n - \n Code Behind shortcuts will now always be active.\n\n\nWhen property setter nodes are used (\nMyClass.MyProperty/\n), the class component is now correctly validated.\n\n\nWhen importing a Xaml namespace, the element is inserted on a newline and formatted to align with other attributes.\n\n\nWhen resolving the binding context for nested DataTemplates, sometimes the binding context resolver would fail on generics or IEnumerables\n\n\nMore resilient Mvvm resolver to drive the 'Go To View Model', 'Go To Xaml View' and 'Go To Code Behind' shortcuts. MFractor will attempt to infer as best possible the associations between those 3 files.\n\n\nSave the project after adding a new file to it.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Notes - v2.6.0\n\n\n31st October 2016\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nThis is a summary of the changes introduced in v2.6.0 of MFractor for Visual Studio Mac.\n\n\nAs a major release, this release adds several code generation capabilities to improve your Xaml workflow. Generate views, classes and value converters in only a few clicks...\n\n\nJust right click on that little yellow squiggle and use the fix to generate a whole lotta code.\n\n\nThere are also more xaml code checks to watch out for nasty Xaml issues and bug fixes galore.\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\n\nNew code generation actions:\n\n\nGenerate classes from \nmy_namespace:MyMissingClass\n in xaml.\n\n\nGenerate views from \nmy_namespace:MyMissingView\n in xaml.\n\n\nGenerate value converters when a missing xaml node ends with \"[cC]onverter] in xaml.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Xaml analysers:\n\n\nFor generics, validate that an x:TypeArguments attribute or xml node setter exists.\n\n\nFor generics, validate that the count of parameters provided to x:TypeArguments matches the generics signature.\n\n\nValidate the root xaml node contains an x:Class directive to set the code behind class name and namespace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnhancements\n\n\n\n\nThis release targets Visual Studio Mac v6.1.1\n\n\n\n\nBug Fixes\n\n\n\n\nFix a bug in xaml namespace resolution that prevented the \"import new xmlns\" fix from triggering.\n\n\nAllow importing of xaml namespaces from x:Static symbols.\n\n\nFor Setters, don't validate TargetType property that the provided type is a static member of System.Type.\n\n\nWhen a symbol name matches but its in the wrong namespace, don't suggest it as a fix.\n\n\nRemove the MFractor settings panel to fix the Visual Studio Mac preferences dialog from not opening when it didn't exist.\n\n\nWhen using native view declaration, the xaml symbolicator will now honor the targetPlatform flag and find the assembly for that platform. Previously this was a naive search that used the first assembly found; using the wrong symbols if a assembly of the same name existed in both an iOS and Android project.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Notes - v2.5.3\n\n\n10th of October 2016\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nThis is a summary of the changes introduced in v2.5.3 of MFractor for Visual Studio Mac.\n\n\nThis release adds support for native view declaration and property generation for missing view attributes.\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\n\nGenerate properties and bindable properties onto classes that implement Xamarin.Forms.ObservableObject.\n\n\nFull support for native view declaration. Tooltips, go-to declaration, xaml analysis and code generation enabled on native views used in Xaml.\n\n\n\n\nBug Fixes\n\n\n\n\nXaml expressions now parsed on attributes that cannot be resolved to a .NET symbol. This enables Tooltips, go-to declaration, xaml analysis and code generation.\n\n\nThe analysis engine no longer assumes that the Xamarin.Forms and Microsoft schemas are the implicit and 'x' namespaces. This means that Xamarin.Forms could be remapped to xmlns:xf etc and the xaml analyser will still function correctly.",
