This is on our roadmap for the future but we have no concrete timeline. A news announcement will be published when we commence work on MFractor for Visual Studio Windows.\n\n\nHow do I get started using MFractor?\n\n\nMFractor does a lot so it may take a little while to learn its ins and outs. If you'd like to learn how to best use it, you have a few options:\n\n\n\n\nRead the in-depth docs for both Xamarin.Forms and Xamarin.Android (see the menu to the left). Each article covers a feature in-depth and fully explains how to use it.\n\n\nDrop into the \n#mfractor Xamarin Slack sub-channel\n and start chatting to me (Matthew Robbins). I'm happy to answer any questions you have.\n\n\n\n\nHow do I file a bug report?\n\n\nIf you notice a bug while you are using MFractor, please file a bug report by taking the following steps:\n\n\n\n\nPrepare a short 2-3 sentence description of the bug, the steps you took that triggered it and the symptoms of the bug.\n\n\nCopy MFractors version information by opening the \nAbout\n dialog (\nHelp\n -\n \nMFractor\n -\n \nAbout\n) and click \nCopy Build Details Into Clipboard\n.\n\n\nEmail the description and build version to \nhello@mfractor.com\n.\n\n\n\n\nHow do I install or update the Android SDK meta-data bundle?\n\n\nIf you'd like to activate tooltips and go-to declaration support for Android SDK resources (for example: \n@android:string/my_string\n), you can install MFractors Android SDK meta-data.\n\n\nTo install, go to the \nHelp\n main menu, select \nMFractor\n and then \nInstall Android SDK Meta-Data\n:\n\n\n\n\nYou will be prompted to confirm the installation; installing the meta-data will wipe any existing installation!\n\n\n\n\nMFractor will then download and install the latest meta-data bundle:\n\n\n\n\nWhen the installation has completed, just close the installation success message; there is no need to restart Visual Studio Mac.\n\n\nWhat is the .droidres folder?\n\n\nThe \n.droidres\n folder contains the meta-data that's generated when MFractor indexes your Android projects. This meta-data is used to power resource tooltips and resource go-to declaration for Android projets.\n\n\nIt is safe to delete whenever you want however some features for Android development won't work correctly without it.\n\n\nShould I check .droidres into source control?\n\n\nNo, you should not check \n.droidres\n into your source control.\n\n\nIf you are using git, append the following text to the end of your \n.gitignore\n to exclude \n.droidres\n:\n\n\n# MFractor's Android meta-data cache\n*.droidres/",

This is accomplished through \ndata binding\n; properties on a view are bound to properties on a backing object through binding mechanisms allowing two-way data transfer between the UI and application logic. For a full tutorial on Mvvm architecture, please Microsofts \nThe Mvvm Pattern\n article.\n\n\nWhen working with Xaml, we can specify a binding context to activate binding expression analysis and a variety of BindingContext specific refactorings.\n\n\nWe can specify a binding context \nexplicitly\n via in inline Xaml expression or \nimplicitly\n through the use of common MVVM naming conventions.\n\n\nExplicit Binding Context Resolution\n\n\nIn Xamarin.Forms, all views have the property \nBindingContext\n; this specifies the object that a view should data-bind with. When coding with Xaml, we can use the \nx:Static\n markup extension to reference a static C# property and explicitly provide an instance of a C# class as the binding context:\n\n\n \nEntry BindingContext=\n{x:Static local:MyStaticClass.MyStaticProperty}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is known as the \nView Model Locator Pattern\n. We implement a static class named \nViewModelLocator\n and use a static, readonly property to return an instance of the object we want our Xaml view to data-bind with. Historically the \nView Model Locator Pattern\n has been used to provide design time data to the Xamarin.Forms Xaml previewer. For a deeper insight into this pattern, read James Montemagnos excellent \nView Model Locator\n article.\n\n\nFor example, given a Xaml page named \nLoginPage\n, we can explicitly provide an instance of \nLoginViewModel\n as the binding context like so:\n\n\nViewModelLocator.cs\n\n\npublic namespace MyApp\n{\n  public static class ViewModelLocator\n  {\n      public static readonly LoginViewModel LoginViewModel = new LoginViewModel();\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nLoginPage.xaml\n\n\nContentPage\n  xmlns:local=\nclr-namespace:MyApp;assembly=MyApp\n\n  BindingContext=\n{x:Static local:ViewModelLocator.LoginViewModel}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen MFractor begins analysis on LoginPage.xaml it will check if any \nBindingContext\n properties have been assigned to. As the root \nContentPage\n assigns a binding context, it will inspect the value component of the \nBindingContext\n attribute, check if it is a Xaml expression and then evaluate it for the return type.\n\n\nFor the \n{x:Static local:ViewModelLocator.LoginViewModel}\n expression, MFractor will resolve the \nViewModelLocator\n class in the \nlocal\n namespace and then grab the C# type of the \nLoginViewModel\n property. This informs MFractor that the page will be bound to a \nLoginViewModel\n instance and therefore to analyse all \nBinding\n expressions against the \nLoginViewModel\n type.\n\n\nExplicit binding context resolution will also work when referencing another element using \nx:Reference\n expressions. For example, we can bind the on/off state of a switch to the visibility of a text label like so:\n\n\n  \nSwitch x:Name=\nmySwitch\n /\n\n  \nLabel BindingContext=\n{x:Reference mySwitch}\n IsVisible=\n{Binding IsToggled}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen MFractor analyses the \n{Binding IsToggled}\n expression, it will evaluate the \n{x:Reference mySwitch}\n expression and use the type of mySwitch as the BindingContext (Xamarin.Forms.Switch).\n\n\nImplicit Binding Context Resolution\n\n\nIn addition to explicit binding context resolution, MFractor will attempt to infer the relationship between your view models and xaml views via \nimplicit binding context resolution\n. This is done by looking for classes and Xaml views that share a common naming convention.\n\n\nLet's consider the following files:\n\n\n\n\nLoginPage.xaml\n - The xaml view.\n\n\nLoginPage.xaml.cs\n - The code behind for the xaml view.\n\n\nLoginViewModel\n - The a C# class that is the view model for the LoginPage view.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause these pages share the prefix \nLogin\n and each has a distinct file extension or suffix, we can infer the following relationships:\n\n\n\n\nThe \n.xaml\n extension denotes that \nLoginPage.xaml\n is a xaml view.\n\n\nThe \n.xaml.cs\n extension and the \nLoginPage\n component denotes that \nLoginPage.xaml.cs\n is the code behind implementation \nLoginPage\n view.\n\n\nThe \nViewModel\n suffix implies that \nLoginViewModel\n is a view model. When \nViewModel\n is removed from \nLoginViewModel\n and \nPage\n is removed from \nLoginPage\n, the \nLogin\n component implies that the \nLoginViewModel\n is related to the \nLoginPage\n xaml view and it's code behind file.\n\n\n\n\nMFractor uses these common naming conventions of Page.xaml, Page.xaml.cs and ViewModel to decide that \nLoginViewModel\n will probably be the BindingContext for \nLoginPage\n. It will then\n\n\nThe following suffixes are supported for Xaml views:\n\n\n\n\nPage\n: EG LoginPage.xaml \n-\n LoginViewModel\n\n\nView\n: EG LoginView.xaml \n-\n LoginViewModel\n\n\n\n\nExplicit binding context resolution will \nalways\n override implicit binding context resolution. If your xaml views are named using the conventions listed above but your page or a view explicitly assigns the \nBindingContext\n property then MFractor will use the \nBindingContext\n return type instead of the implicit Mvvm relationship.\n\n\nData Template Binding Context Resolution\n\n\nData templates are used to provide a nested Xaml view to a view that displays many occurances of that view. For example, a ListView uses a \nDataTemplate\n to specify the view appearance of each instance provided through the \nItemsSource\n property.\n\n\nMFractor will attempt to infer the BindingContext for a data templates view by resolving the \nItemsSource\n property on the wrapping view.\n\n\nConsider the following code:\n\n\n  \nListView ItemsSource=\n{Binding Contacts}\n\n      \nListView.ItemTemplate\n\n        \nDataTemplate\n\n          \nTextCell Text=\n{Binding DisplayName}\n /\n\n        \n/DataTemplate\n\n      \n/ListView.ItemTemplate\n\n  \n/ListView\n\n\n\n\n\nThe inner \nDataTemplate\n has a \nTextCell\n where the \nText\n property is provided by the binding expression \n{Binding DisplayName}\n. To analyse this expression, MFractor requires a binding context; MFractor will walk out to the encapsulating view (ListView), locate the \nItemsSource\n property and evaluate the expression.\n\n\nWhen the return type is an \nIEnumerable\n or array, MFractor unwraps the generic or array and grabs the inner type. This provides the binding context type for the binding expressions used within the data template.\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nIn summary, we've learnt that MFractor will use the binding context to power the Xaml analyser and navigation improvements.\n\n\n\n\nBinding expressions require a binding context to be analysed.\n\n\nWe can explicitly specify a binding context by assigning the \nBindingContext\n property of any Xaml element.\n\n\nWhen we name our code files using the Page.xaml, Page.xaml.cs and ViewModel convention, MFractor will assume an implicit MVVM relationship.\n\n\nData templates use the return type of the wrapping views \nItemSource\n property.",

For the  {x:Static local:ViewModelLocator.LoginViewModel}  expression, MFractor will resolve the  ViewModelLocator  class in the  local  namespace and then grab the C# type of the  LoginViewModel  property. This informs MFractor that the page will be bound to a  LoginViewModel  instance and therefore to analyse all  Binding  expressions against the  LoginViewModel  type.  Explicit binding context resolution will also work when referencing another element using  x:Reference  expressions. For example, we can bind the on/off state of a switch to the visibility of a text label like so:     Switch x:Name= mySwitch  / \n   Label BindingContext= {x:Reference mySwitch}  IsVisible= {Binding IsToggled} /   When MFractor analyses the  {Binding IsToggled}  expression, it will evaluate the  {x:Reference mySwitch}  expression and use the type of mySwitch as the BindingContext (Xamarin.Forms.Switch).",

This is done by looking for classes and Xaml views that share a common naming convention.  Let's consider the following files:   LoginPage.xaml  - The xaml view.  LoginPage.xaml.cs  - The code behind for the xaml view.  LoginViewModel  - The a C# class that is the view model for the LoginPage view.    Because these pages share the prefix  Login  and each has a distinct file extension or suffix, we can infer the following relationships:   The  .xaml  extension denotes that  LoginPage.xaml  is a xaml view.  The  .xaml.cs  extension and the  LoginPage  component denotes that  LoginPage.xaml.cs  is the code behind implementation  LoginPage  view.  The  ViewModel  suffix implies that  LoginViewModel  is a view model. When  ViewModel  is removed from  LoginViewModel  and  Page  is removed from  LoginPage , the  Login  component implies that the  LoginViewModel  is related to the  LoginPage  xaml view and it's code behind file.   MFractor uses these common naming conventions of Page.xaml, Page.xaml.cs and ViewModel to decide that  LoginViewModel  will probably be the BindingContext for  LoginPage . It will then  The following suffixes are supported for Xaml views:   Page : EG LoginPage.xaml  -  LoginViewModel  View : EG LoginView.xaml  -  LoginViewModel   Explicit binding context resolution will  always  override implicit binding context resolution.

This is a Xamarin.Forms API that implements the \nIMarkupExtension interface\n; it reflects changes from the binding context to the view and vice-versa.\n\n\nWe use the binding markup extension syntax in our Xaml views:\n\n\nLoginPage.xaml.cs\n\n\nEntry Text=\n{Binding Username}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nLoginViewModel.cs\n\n\npublic class LoginViewModel\n{\n  public string Username { get; set; }\n}\n\n\n\n\nIn the above example, \n{Binding Username}\n points to a public property on the \nLogingPage\ns binding context, the \nLoginViewModel\n. When the user enters text, changes are automatically applied into the \nUsername\n property.\n\n\nBut what if we introduced a new \nEntry\n bound to \nPassword\n, a property that doesn't exist on the \nLoginViewModel\n:\n\n\nLoginPage.xaml.cs\n\n\nEntry Text=\n{Binding Username}\n/\n\n\nEntry Text=\n{Binding Password}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nProvided we have configured the views binding context correctly, the \nXaml analyser\n recognises this is a runtime bug and marks it:\n\n\n\n\nMFractor encourages a \nXaml first\n workflow; you write out bindings in Xaml and then generate the implementation on the view model.\n\n\nThis is a big change to existing workflows. Previously, we coded these properties by hand and wire them up manually in the Xaml; an approach both time-consuming and error prone. You have to remember property names, property types, control types and then you need to write this all out by hand!\n\n\nUsing binding generation we can \nliterally\n eliminate minutes of work and hundreds of keystrokes in a few clicks.\n\n\nMFractor provides the following shortcuts to implement our bound properties:\n\n\n\n\nFix Missing Binding\n: A code issue fix that generates a single binding property onto the view model.\n\n\nImplement View Model\n: A refactoring action that collects \nall\n missing bindings and generates them in bulk on the view model.\n\n\n\n\nLet's examine these two methods of implementing missing properties using MFractor.\n\n\nIssue Fixing on Missing Bindings\n\n\nWhen MFractor detects that a property in a binding expression doesn't exist on the binding context, it adds a code issue at the missing bindings location.\n\n\nTo action the code isxue fix, we right click on the issue (underlined in yellow), navigate to \nFix\n and then select \nGenerate a property...\n.\n\n\n\n\nWe have two options available when generating a property:\n\n\nGenerate a property named XXX in XXX\n creates a new public property with a public \nget\n and \nset\n accessor:\n\n\npublic string Password { get; set; }\n\n\n\n\nGenerate a property named XXX in XXX with backing fields\n creates a new public property with a public \nget\n and \nset\n accessor that sets or gets a backing field:\n\n\nprivate string _password;\npublic string Password\n{\n  get\n  {\n    return _password;\n  }\n  set\n  {\n    _password = value;\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe default getter / setter fix is most useful when:\n\n\n\n\nWe want a plain old property with no backing logic.\n\n\nWe are using Fody's \nImplementPropertyChanged\n attribute on our ViewModel to automatically add INotifyPropertyChanged behaviour.\n\n\n\n\nThe backing field fix is most useful when:\n\n\n\n\nWe want backing logic that occurs when our property changes.\n\n\nWe occasionally want to manipulate the properties backing field without changes propagating to the UI.\n\n\n\n\nThe Implement ViewModel Refactoring\n\n\nAnother way to generate properties for a view model is to use the \nImplement View Model\n refactoring. This shortcut collects \nall\n missing binding expressions (excluding bindings inside DataTemplates) and generates them in bulk onto the binding context.\n\n\nWe can access this short cut by right clicking anywhere in a Xaml file, navigating to \nGenerate\n and then selecting the \nImplement View Model\n action:\n\n\n\n\nYou'll notice that there are 2 actions:\n\n\n\n\nImplement View Model\n gathers all missing bindings in the xaml document and implements them all as public properties with a public \nget\n and \nset\n accessor.\n\n\nImplement View Model (Use Backing Fields)\n gathers all missing bindings in the xaml document and implements them all as public properties with a public \nget\n and \nset\n accessor that sets or gets a backing field.\n\n\n\n\nThere are often cases when a binding context isn't specified \nexplicitly \n and can't be inferred \nimplicitly\n. A common example of this is that you have just started to build a Xaml view and haven't yet got around to building the corresponding view model.\n\n\nThe \nImplement View Model\n action can also generate a view model class for the Xaml view if one is not already defined. Using Mvvm naming conventions, MFractor generates a view model class for your xaml view under the \nMyDefaultNamespace.ViewModels\n namespace.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\nLoginPage.xaml.cs\n\n\nEntry Text=\n{Binding Username}\n/\n\n\nEntry Text=\n{Binding Password}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen creating the view model class, MFractor removes the \nPage\n or \nView\n suffix from the view name and then attaches \nViewModel\n to the end of the resulting name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove the \nPage\n or \nView\n suffix: LoginPage -\n Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttach the \nViewModel\n suffix: Login -\n LoginViewModel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerate a new class named \nLoginViewModel\n under the namespace \nMyDefaultNamespace.ViewModels\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis would result in the following view model class file:\n\n\nLoginViewModel.cs\n\n\npublic namespace MyDefaultNamespace.ViewModels\n{\n  public class LoginViewModel\n  {\n    public string Username { get; set; }\n    public string Password { get; set; }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nIf you project references Fody's \nImplementPropertyChanged\n extension, the default getter / setter implementation will also annotate the result with the \n[ImplementPropertyChanged.PropertyChanged]\n attribute:\n\n\nLoginViewModel.cs\n\n\n[ImplementPropertyChanged.PropertyChanged]\npublic class LoginViewModel\n{\n}\n\n\n\n\nGenerating Commands Implementations\n\n\nWhen MFractor encounters a property that expects the \nSystem.Windows.Input.ICommand\n interface, it will generate a property returning a empty command implementation.\n\n\nFor example, we bind our login button to a \nLoginCommand\n property on our view model:\n\n\nButton Command=\n{Binding LoginCommand}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen MFractor generates the property for \nLoginCommand\n, it creates an empty command implementation:\n\n\npublic System.Windows.Input.ICommand LoginCommand\n{\n    get\n    {\n        return new Xamarin.Forms.Command(() =\n\n        {\n            throw new NotImplementedException();\n        }\n\n        );\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nBinding Generation And Value Converters\n\n\nWhen a binding expression uses a \nConverter\n, MFractor will attempt to resolve the input type of the referenced value converter and use that as the property type. We must have a value conversion attribute on the \nIValueConverter\n for MFractor to resolve the input type.

We accomplish this data-transfer behaviour through the  Binding Markup Extension . This is a Xamarin.Forms API that implements the  IMarkupExtension interface ; it reflects changes from the binding context to the view and vice-versa.  We use the binding markup extension syntax in our Xaml views:  LoginPage.xaml.cs  Entry Text= {Binding Username} /   LoginViewModel.cs  public class LoginViewModel\n{\n  public string Username { get; set; }\n}  In the above example,  {Binding Username}  points to a public property on the  LogingPage s binding context, the  LoginViewModel . When the user enters text, changes are automatically applied into the  Username  property.  But what if we introduced a new  Entry  bound to  Password , a property that doesn't exist on the  LoginViewModel :  LoginPage.xaml.cs  Entry Text= {Binding Username} /  Entry Text= {Binding Password} /   Provided we have configured the views binding context correctly, the  Xaml analyser  recognises this is a runtime bug and marks it:   MFractor encourages a  Xaml first  workflow; you write out bindings in Xaml and then generate the implementation on the view model.  This is a big change to existing workflows. Previously, we coded these properties by hand and wire them up manually in the Xaml; an approach both time-consuming and error prone. You have to remember property names, property types, control types and then you need to write this all out by hand!  Using binding generation we can  literally  eliminate minutes of work and hundreds of keystrokes in a few clicks.  MFractor provides the following shortcuts to implement our bound properties:   Fix Missing Binding : A code issue fix that generates a single binding property onto the view model.  Implement View Model : A refactoring action that collects  all  missing bindings and generates them in bulk on the view model.   Let's examine these two methods of implementing missing properties using MFractor.",

We have two options available when generating a property:  Generate a property named XXX in XXX  creates a new public property with a public  get  and  set  accessor:  public string Password { get; set; }  Generate a property named XXX in XXX with backing fields  creates a new public property with a public  get  and  set  accessor that sets or gets a backing field:  private string _password;\npublic string Password\n{\n  get\n  {\n    return _password;\n  }\n  set\n  {\n    _password = value;\n  }\n}  The default getter / setter fix is most useful when:   We want a plain old property with no backing logic.  We are using Fody's  ImplementPropertyChanged  attribute on our ViewModel to automatically add INotifyPropertyChanged behaviour.

This shortcut collects  all  missing binding expressions (excluding bindings inside DataTemplates) and generates them in bulk onto the binding context.  We can access this short cut by right clicking anywhere in a Xaml file, navigating to  Generate  and then selecting the  Implement View Model  action:   You'll notice that there are 2 actions:   Implement View Model  gathers all missing bindings in the xaml document and implements them all as public properties with a public  get  and  set  accessor.  Implement View Model (Use Backing Fields)  gathers all missing bindings in the xaml document and implements them all as public properties with a public  get  and  set  accessor that sets or gets a backing field.   There are often cases when a binding context isn't specified  explicitly   and can't be inferred  implicitly . A common example of this is that you have just started to build a Xaml view and haven't yet got around to building the corresponding view model.  The  Implement View Model  action can also generate a view model class for the Xaml view if one is not already defined. Using Mvvm naming conventions, MFractor generates a view model class for your xaml view under the  MyDefaultNamespace.ViewModels  namespace.  For example:  LoginPage.xaml.cs  Entry Text= {Binding Username} /  Entry Text= {Binding Password} /   When creating the view model class, MFractor removes the  Page  or  View  suffix from the view name and then attaches  ViewModel  to the end of the resulting name.     Remove the  Page  or  View  suffix: LoginPage -  Login      Attach the  ViewModel  suffix: Login -  LoginViewModel      Generate a new class named  LoginViewModel  under the namespace  MyDefaultNamespace.ViewModels .     This would result in the following view model class file:  LoginViewModel.cs  public namespace MyDefaultNamespace.ViewModels\n{\n  public class LoginViewModel\n  {\n    public string Username { get; set; }\n    public string Password { get; set; }\n  }\n}  If you project references Fody's  ImplementPropertyChanged  extension, the default getter / setter implementation will also annotate the result with the  [ImplementPropertyChanged.PropertyChanged]  attribute:  LoginViewModel.cs  [ImplementPropertyChanged.PropertyChanged]\npublic class LoginViewModel\n{\n}",

For instance; @layout/myLayout.\n\n\n\n\nWhen MFractor detects the cursor is within one of these expressions, resource tooltips and go-to-declaration become active. This enables fast and efficient code navigation.\n\n\nThat is much faster than manual searching! Now lets go over each of these expression types.\n\n\nC# Resource Expressions\n\n\nFor C#, resource expressions are always resolved against the Resource.Designer.cs file that is generated alongside a project. This section assumes a basic familiarity of the Resource.Designer.cs file; if this is a new concept I suggested reading the \nAndroid Resource Basics\n page in Xamarins documentation.\n\n\nThe components of a supported resource expression are formatted like so:\n\n\n[Project Namespace].[Resource].[ResourceType].[ResourceName]\n\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\n\n\n[Project Namespace] is the project namespace that the Resources designer class resides. This component is either:\n\n\nImplicit: The encapsulating namespace is the same as the resource designers namespace or a using statement provides the resource designer class.\n\n\nExplicit: The expression explicitly uses the namespace that owns the resource class.\n\n\nResource is the constant Resource class that wraps the declarations of the ResourceType sub-classes.\n\n\nResourceType is the nested resource type class.\n\n\nResourceName is the name of the resource being referenced. MFractor will only trigger its behaviour when your caret or mouse cursor is over this component of the c# resource expression.\n\n\n\n\nAn example of a valid expression would be:\n\n\nResources.String.my_string;\n\n\n\n\nWhen your cursor is over the my_string component of this expression, MFractor will attempt to resolve a string resource named my_string.\n\n\nXml Resource Expressions\n\n\nXml resource expressions come in 3 different categories:\n\n\n\n\nReference expressions point directly to a resource. They begin with the \u2018@\u2019 character.\n\n\nDeclarative expressions declare a new resource. These are only used with ids. They begin with a \u2018@+\u2019 character sequence.\n\n\nTheme expression point to a component of the currently scoped theme. They begin with a \u2018?\u2019 character.\n\n\n\n\nReference and declarative expression are structured with the following syntax:\n\n\n@[+][PackageName:]resourceType/resourceName\n\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@[+] is the resource reference symbol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackageName is an optional component that points to the package the resource is within.\n\n\n\n\nresourceType is the resource type.\n\n\nresourceName is the name of the resource.\n\n\n\n\nAn example of this would be:\n\n\n@string/my_string\n\n\n\n\nWhen your cursor is any component of this expression, MFractor will attempt to resolve a pre-existing string resource named my_string.\n\n\nLastly, theme resource expressions point to a component of the current theme. These are structured with the following syntax:\n\n\n?[PackageName:][ResourceType/]themeItemName\n\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\n\n\nPackageName is the optional package name the theme component resides within.\n\n\nResourceType is the optional resource type of the theme component. This is typically inferred.\n\n\nthemeItemName the name of the theme item.\n\n\n\n\nGo To Resource Declaration\n\n\nFind All Resource Usages\n\n\nResource Tooltips\n\n\nImage Tooltips",

declaring the resources for a page/view, it is common to accidentally put resources directly inside a \nMyPage.Resources\n rather than wrapping the elements with a \nResourceDictionary\n declaration.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n?xml version=\n1.0\n encoding=\nutf-8\n?\n\n\nContentPage xmlns=\nhttp://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms\n\n    xmlns:x=\nhttp://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml\n\n    x:Class=\nHelloMFractor.HelloMFractorPage\n\n    \nContentPage.Resources\n\n        \nx:String\nHello World!\n/x:String\n\n    \n/ContentPage.Resources\n\n\n/ContentPage\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the above example, the declaration \nx:String\nHello World!\n/x:String\n is declared directly inside the property setter, which will cause a type-mismatch exception at runtime.\n\n\nWhen actioned, the \nEncapsulate with resource dictionary\n fix will wrap elements inside a resources property setter node with a resource dictionary. This would correct the above sample to:\n\n\n?xml version=\n1.0\n encoding=\nutf-8\n?\n\n\nContentPage xmlns=\nhttp://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms\n\n    xmlns:x=\nhttp://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml\n\n    x:Class=\nHelloMFractor.HelloMFractorPage\n\n    \nContentPage.Resources\n\n    \nResourceDictionary\n\n          \nx:String\nHello World!\n/x:String\n\n    \n/ResourceDictionary\n\n    \n/ContentPage.Resources\n\n\n/ContentPage\n\n\n\n\n\nImport Value Converter For Binding\n\n\nConfiguration Id: com.mfractor.code_fixes.forms.import_resolving_value_converter\n\n\nInspects for IValueConverter implementations within the project and it's references that match the value conversion flow for this binding type mismatch. IValueConverter implementations must be annotated with the \nValueConversionAttribute\n to be detected by this fix.\n\n\nCreate Value Converter That Resolves Type Flow\n\n\nConfiguration Id: com.mfractor.code_fixes.forms.create_resolving_value_converter\n\n\nUsing the input and output type for a value conversion path, this code fix will create a new value converter implementation for the input and output type.\n\n\nConfigurable Properties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nType\n\n\nDefaults To\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefaultConverterNamespace\n\n\nSystem.String\n\n\n\"converters\"\n\n\nThe namespace name of the xmlns import statement for the newly created value converter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUses:\n\n\n\n\nGenerate IValueConverter Implementation",

            "text": "Configuration Id: com.mfractor.code_fixes.forms.encapsulate_with_resource_dictionary  When declaring the resources for a page/view, it is common to accidentally put resources directly inside a  MyPage.Resources  rather than wrapping the elements with a  ResourceDictionary  declaration.  Example:  ?xml version= 1.0  encoding= utf-8 ?  ContentPage xmlns= http://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms \n    xmlns:x= http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml \n    x:Class= HelloMFractor.HelloMFractorPage \n     ContentPage.Resources \n         x:String Hello World! /x:String \n     /ContentPage.Resources  /ContentPage   In the above example, the declaration  x:String Hello World! /x:String  is declared directly inside the property setter, which will cause a type-mismatch exception at runtime.  When actioned, the  Encapsulate with resource dictionary  fix will wrap elements inside a resources property setter node with a resource dictionary.

To work around this, declare the id explicitly with \nitem type=\"id\" name=\"...\" /\n instead.\n\n\nDetect Duplicate Plurals Entries\n\n\nInspects a 'plurals' resource entry for 'item' elements that have the same 'quantity' value.\n\n\nCheck For Required Value\n\n\nChecks that the input argument for an XML attribute matches the required value for that attribute. For example, 'xmlns:android' must always be 'http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android'.\n\n\nCheck For Invalid Characters In Value Resource Names\n\n\nChecks that the 'name' attribute for value based resources do not contain invalid characters. Any character apart for 0-9, a-z, A-Z, '.' and '_' are considered to be an invalid character. This check prevents characters that are also operators (such as +, * or \n) from being baked into the Resource.Designer.cs file when the resource ids are generated.\n\n\nValidate Flag Input\n\n\nValidates that any flags provided to an xml attribute are valid.\n\n\nValid Keyword Input\n\n\nValidates that a keyword or sequence of flags provided to an xml attribute are valid. For instance, the installation location is doen by the 'android:installLocation' manifest attribute. This attribute only accepts 'internalOnly', 'auto' and 'preferExternal', any other value is a compilation error.\n\n\nItem Value Resource Is Valid\n\n\nChecks that the content contained within an \n tag that declares a value resource declaration is a valid format for its type.\n\n\nMispelt Resource Type References\n\n\nChecks that the resource references (EG: @string/myString) have a valid resource type component and suggests an auto-correction if possible.\n\n\nMultiple \n usages in manifest\n\n\nInspects the \n element within the Android manifest for multiple declarations of the \n element. Only a single \n element is allowed.\n\n\nDrawable 9-patch reference check.\n\n\nChecks that a drawable reference does not end with '.9'.\n\n\nNode Missing Required Attributes\n\n\nChecks that a given resource node has all the mandatory attributes.\n\n\nCheck Reference Type\n\n\nVerifies that an attribute that expects a resource reference is provided a reference expression (@type/value) rather than a literal value.\n\n\nValidate quotations in \n elements.\n\n\nVerifies that quotation marks (' and \") are properly escaped when inside a string resource. For instance, single quotes (') must be escaped by a preceeding '\\' unless the whole string is wrapped within double quotes (\"). Furthermore, the use of double quotes must be escaped unless they enclose the entire string.\n\n\nResource Value Format\n\n\nValidates that a resource value (such as a dimension, color or percentage) is entered in the correct format.\n\n\nValues Resource Is Valid\n\n\nChecks that the content contained within a value resource declaration is a valid format for its type.\n\n\nVerify Input Type\n\n\nChecks that a xml attribute accepts the resource type used in a reference expression (EG: @string/myString).\n\n\nVerify Max API Feature Usages\n\n\nChecks that xml resources use Android SDK features that are within the projects Target API level.\n\n\nVerify Resource Exists\n\n\nChecks that a resource used via a reference expression (EG: @string/myString) exists within the project or its references.\n\n\nCheck for Duplicate Attributes.\n\n\nChecks for duplicate attributes on an xml node and then automatically removes the duplicates.\n\n\nTextView 'textSize' uses non-sp dimension\n\n\nInspects 'textSize' attributes for usages of non-sp dimensions\n\n\nValidate Animated Vectors Reference Vector Drawables\n\n\nVerifies that the 'android:drawable' attribute on an 'animated-vector' drawable resource points to a 'vector' base drawable.\n\n\nAppWidget Layout Is Valid\n\n\nAnalyses the layout file referenced by the 'android:initialLayout' attribute for an AppWidget configuration and ensures that it only contains allowed view types.\n\n\nCircular Resource Usage\n\n\nDetects when a resource usage (@type/value) that points to a file based resource (such as a layout or drawable) will generate a circular reference when it is inflated. A common example of this is using \ninclude\n or \nmerge\n tags inside a layout that also references other layouts via merging or including.\n\n\nInconsistent Array Sizes\n\n\nChecks that 'array', 'string-array' and 'integer-array' resources with multiple declarations all have the same number of elements across all locales they are declared in.\n\n\nLayout \n exists in configuration\n\n\nChecks that usages of 'include' tags within a Android layout reference a layout that is available within the current configuration.\n\n\nLayout Width And Height Required\n\n\nChecks that layout elements have both the 'android:layout_width' and 'android:layout_height' attributes declared.

For example if both \nxmlns:local=\"clr-namespace:MFractor.Licensing.MobileApp\"\n and \nxmlns:myassembly=\"clr-namespace:MFractor.Licensing.MobileApp\"\n were declared, this analyser would warn that they both reference the same assembly and namespace.\n\n\nCode Behind Class Type Mismatch\n\n\nInspects the type defined by the root Xaml node and compares it against the base type of the code behind class to check for a type-mismatch.\n\n\nRoot Element Defines Code Behind Class\n\n\nChecks that the root xaml node defines a code behind class using the \nx:Class\n directive\n\n\nUnused Resource\n\n\nInspects that resource dictionary entries are used via the \nStaticResource\n markup extension expression within this document.\n\n\nContentView Has Multiple Direct Children\n\n\nInspects usages of the \nContentView\n element and checks that it only has a single child view. Assigning multiple children into a \nContentView\n is a common mistake where the developer usually intended to wrap the chid views with a \nGrid\n or a \nStackLayout\n.\n\n\nContentPage Has Multiple Direct Children\n\n\nInspects usages of \nContentPage\n and checks that it only has a single child view.

This action won't be available if the attribute value is an expression.\n  - Right click on a xaml attribute property that has a literal value and extract it into a `Binding` expression. This action is not available if the attribute value is an expression or the attribute does not have a corresponding bindable property.\n  - **Organise Refactorings:**\n      - The *Collapse Xaml Attributes* refactoring will collapse all xaml attributes onto the same line as the parent xaml node.\n      - The *Expand Xaml Attributes* refactoring will expand all xaml attributes onto separate lines.\n      - The *Sort Xaml Attributes* refactoring will sort the attributes for a xaml node by namespace and name.\n      - The *Expand Node* refactoring takes a self-closing xaml node and generate a closing tag for it.\n      - The *Collapse Node* refactoring takes a xaml node with no children and a closing tag and removes the closing tag to make the node self-closing.\n - **New Code Generators**\n  - Right click on an xaml node that inherits from `Xamarin.Forms.VisualElement` or `Xamarin.Forms.Application` and select **Add Resource Dictionary** to generate a resource dictionary for that element.\n - **New Xaml Analysers**\n  - Detect when an `x:Name` code-behind field declaration is empty.\n\n\n\n##Enhancements\n\n\n\n\nThis release targets Visual Studio Mac v6.1.5\n\n\nThe \nImplement View Model\n refactoring has been moved from the \nRefactor\n menu to \nGenerate\n.\n\n\nHover over a xaml attribute property that's a \nSystem.Drawing.Color\n or a \nXamarin.Forms.Color\n to see the color value inside the tooltip.\n\n\nThe Android SDK meta-data has been removed from MFractor.mpack; you can download and update the sdk meta-data through the \nHelp\n -\n \nMFractor\n -\n \nInstall Android SDK Meta-Data\n menu item.\n\n\n\n\n##Bug Fixes\n\n\n\n\nCorrectly validate the type provided to x:TypeArguments; there was a bug in the type checking algorithm.\n\n\nDon't allow the 'Simplify' refactoring to run against expressions.\n\n\nFix multiple type conversion checking bugs in the ValueConversion attribute validation.\n\n\n\n\n##Release Notes - v2.7.0\n\n\n8th January 2017\n\n\nDownload MFractor 2.7.0\n\n\n##Introduction\n\n\nThis is a summary of the changes introduced in v2.7.0 of MFractor for Visual Studio Mac.\n\n\nThis release adds the ability implement entire view models, introduces a dozen xaml analysers and fixes many bugs.\n\n\nI recommend taking a moment to read these tutorials:\n\n\n* [Implementing View Models](/xamarin-forms/implementing-view-models.md): Learn implement entire view models using the **Implement View Model** refactoring.\n* [Value Converter Type Safety](/xamarin-forms/value-converter-type-safety.md): Learn to annotate `IValueConverter`s with value conversion attributes for `Converter` expression type-safety.\n\n\n\n##Introducing View Model Generation\n\n\nYou already love being able to generate bindings but I've taken it to the next level this release \ud83d\udcaa\n\n\n\n\nGot a heap of unimplemented bindings?

Then MFractor simply inserts the missing bindings into the existing view model.\n\n\nI think it'll save you enough time during the week that you may just get to Friday beers a few hours early \ud83c\udf7b\n\n\n##Features\n\n\n- By right clicking anywhere in a Xaml document, implement all missing bindings as a new or into an existing view model:\n    - Implement view model properties with a getter and setter.\n    - Implement view model properties with a backing field.\n    - Bound properties that return `ICommand` will have an empty `Xamarin.Forms.Command` instance generated.\n    - When MFractor encounters binding expressions that use a `Converter`, it inspects the converter for a `ValueConversion` attribute to deduce the input typed required. If it can't resolve the converter or the converter does not have value conversion information, it will default to using `System.Object`.\n    - When implementing a new view model with getter and setters, MFractor will inspect for references to Fody's `ImplementPropertyChanged` and annotate the new class with it.\n- **New Xaml Analysers:**\n    - Validate that elements declared inside a resource dictionary have an x:Key.\n    - Validate that elements declared inside a resource dictionary have a unique x:Key value.\n    - Detect when an x:TypeArguments is used on a non-generic type and warn of incorrect usage.\n    - Detect when a property setter node (`\nMyClass.MyProperty/\n`) references a non-existent member on the parent class.\n    - Detect when a property setter attribute is empty.\n    - Detect when an undefined static resource is referenced by a `StaticResource` expression.\n    - Detect when the value returned by a `StaticResource` expression causes a type mismatch.\n    - Detect when an unknown type is being provided to a `x:TypeArguments` attribute.\n    - Validate that `OnIdiom` elements return the correct type for the outer property setter.\n    - Validate that `OnPlatform` elements return the correct type for the outer property setter.\n    - Detect when a developer has misused a property setter inside another xaml element. For example, `OnIdiom.Phone` doesn't make any sense when wrapped by the outer element `OnPlatform`.\n    - Detect when an incorrect input type is provided to a `Converter`. The value converter must have a `ValueConversion` attribute for this to trigger.\n    - Detect when an incorrect output type is returned by a `Converter` expression. The value converter must have a `ValueConversion` attribute for this to trigger.\n    - Detect when multiple occurrences of the same automation ID exists within a Xaml document.\n- **New Xaml Fixes:**\n    - Generate missing resource dictionary keys.\n    - Auto-correct misspelt `StaticResource` references.\n- **New Simplify Refactorings:**\n    - Attributes that use a static instance to initialize the property (eg `VerticalOptions=\"LayoutOptions.CentreAndExpand\"`) can now be simplified to just the instance name (eg `VerticalOptions=\"CentreAndExpand\"`).\n\n\n\n##Enhancements\n\n\n- This release targets Visual Studio Mac v6.1.3\n- The **About MFractor** dialog now contains a button to copy version and IDE information into the clipboard for bug reports.

See [FormsCommunityToolkit.Converters](https://github.com/FormsCommunityToolkit/Converters) for examples.\n\n\n\n##Bug Fixes\n\n\n- Sometimes the Xaml document analyser would fail to load and bring down the Xaml editor. This has been fixed.\n- The View \n - \n Code Behind navigation shortcuts would break when an AST parse was in progress. View \n - \n Code Behind shortcuts will now always be active.\n- When property setter nodes are used (`\nMyClass.MyProperty/\n`), the class component is now correctly validated.\n- When importing a Xaml namespace, the element is inserted on a newline and formatted to align with other attributes.\n- When resolving the binding context for nested DataTemplates, sometimes the binding context resolver would fail on generics or IEnumerables\n- More resilient Mvvm resolver to drive the 'Go To View Model', 'Go To Xaml View' and 'Go To Code Behind' shortcuts. MFractor will attempt to infer as best possible the associations between those 3 files.\n- Save the project after adding a new file to it.\n\n\n##Release Notes - v2.6.0\n\n**31st October 2016**\n\n**[Download MFractor 2.6.0](http://addins.mfractor.com/releases/2.06.00/MFractor.MFractor_2.06.00.mpack)**\n\n##Introduction\n\nThis is a summary of the changes introduced in v2.6.0 of MFractor for Visual Studio Mac.\n\nAs a major release, this release adds several code generation capabilities to improve your Xaml workflow. Generate views, classes and value converters in only a few clicks...\n\nJust right click on that little yellow squiggle and use the fix to generate a whole lotta code.\n\nThere are also more xaml code checks to watch out for nasty Xaml issues and bug fixes galore.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n##Features\n\n - **New code generation actions:**\n    - Generate classes from `\nmy_namespace:MyMissingClass\n` in xaml.\n    - Generate views from `\nmy_namespace:MyMissingView\n` in xaml.\n    - Generate value converters when a missing xaml node ends with \"[cC]onverter] in xaml.\n - **New Xaml analysers:**\n    - For generics, validate that an x:TypeArguments attribute or xml node setter exists.\n    - For generics, validate that the count of parameters provided to x:TypeArguments matches the generics signature.\n    - Validate the root xaml node contains an x:Class directive to set the code behind class name and namespace.\n\n##Enhancements\n\n - This release targets Visual Studio Mac v6.1.1\n\n## Bug Fixes\n\n - Fix a bug in xaml namespace resolution that prevented the \"import new xmlns\" fix from triggering.\n - Allow importing of xaml namespaces from x:Static symbols.\n - For Setters, don't validate TargetType property that the provided type is a static member of System.Type.\n - When a symbol name matches but its in the wrong namespace, don't suggest it as a fix.\n - Remove the MFractor settings panel to fix the Visual Studio Mac preferences dialog from not opening when it didn't exist.\n - When using native view declaration, the xaml symbolicator will now honor the targetPlatform flag and find the assembly for that platform. Previously this was a naive search that used the first assembly found; using the wrong symbols if a assembly of the same name existed in both an iOS and Android project.\n\n\n ##Release Notes - v2.5.3\n\n **10th of October 2016**\n\n **[Download MFractor 2.5.0](http://addins.mfractor.com/releases/2.06.00/MFractor.MFractor_2.06.00.mpack)**\n\n ##Introduction\n\n This is a summary of the changes introduced in v2.5.3 of MFractor for Visual Studio Mac.\n\n This release adds support for native view declaration and property generation for missing view attributes.\n\n ##Features\n\n  - Generate properties and bindable properties onto classes that implement Xamarin.Forms.ObservableObject.\n  - Full support for native view declaration. Tooltips, go-to declaration, xaml analysis and code generation enabled on native views used in Xaml.\n\n ##Bug Fixes\n\n  - Xaml expressions now parsed on attributes that cannot be resolved to a .NET symbol. This enables Tooltips, go-to declaration, xaml analysis and code generation.\n  - The analysis engine no longer assumes that the Xamarin.Forms and Microsoft schemas are the implicit and 'x' namespaces. This means that Xamarin.Forms could be remapped to xmlns:xf etc and the xaml analyser will still function correctly.",

The  Model  suffix (EG: LoginModel) is now supported for view  -  view model  -  code behind association.  This release targets Visual Studio Mac v6.2.   ##Bug Fixes   Undefined StaticResource detection has been disabled in this release.  Fixed: When generating view models, if a binding expression was within an undefined control property, the refactoring would fail as it could not resolve the member type. Undefined properties will now auto-generate using  System.Object .  Fixed: When generating a static property from an x:Static expression whose outer attribute is unresolved, now default to use  System.Object .

This release focuses on adding new refactoring and code generation actions into the Xaml editor.  You can now sort your xaml, edit colors interactively, extract values into binding expressions and more:   ##Features   - **New Refactorings**\n  - Right click on a xaml attribute property that's a `System.Drawing.Color` or a `Xamarin.Forms.Color` and edit it using the color selection dialog. This action won't be available if the attribute value is an expression.\n  - Right click on a xaml attribute property that has a literal value and extract it into a `Binding` expression. This action is not available if the attribute value is an expression or the attribute does not have a corresponding bindable property.\n  - **Organise Refactorings:**\n      - The *Collapse Xaml Attributes* refactoring will collapse all xaml attributes onto the same line as the parent xaml node.\n      - The *Expand Xaml Attributes* refactoring will expand all xaml attributes onto separate lines.\n      - The *Sort Xaml Attributes* refactoring will sort the attributes for a xaml node by namespace and name.\n      - The *Expand Node* refactoring takes a self-closing xaml node and generate a closing tag for it.\n      - The *Collapse Node* refactoring takes a xaml node with no children and a closing tag and removes the closing tag to make the node self-closing.\n - **New Code Generators**\n  - Right click on an xaml node that inherits from `Xamarin.Forms.VisualElement` or `Xamarin.Forms.Application` and select **Add Resource Dictionary** to generate a resource dictionary for that element.\n - **New Xaml Analysers**\n  - Detect when an `x:Name` code-behind field declaration is empty.  ##Enhancements   This release targets Visual Studio Mac v6.1.5  The  Implement View Model  refactoring has been moved from the  Refactor  menu to  Generate .  Hover over a xaml attribute property that's a  System.Drawing.Color  or a  Xamarin.Forms.Color  to see the color value inside the tooltip.  The Android SDK meta-data has been removed from MFractor.mpack; you can download and update the sdk meta-data through the  Help  -   MFractor  -   Install Android SDK Meta-Data  menu item.   ##Bug Fixes   Correctly validate the type provided to x:TypeArguments; there was a bug in the type checking algorithm.  Don't allow the 'Simplify' refactoring to run against expressions.  Fix multiple type conversion checking bugs in the ValueConversion attribute validation.   ##Release Notes - v2.7.0  8th January 2017  Download MFractor 2.7.0  ##Introduction  This is a summary of the changes introduced in v2.7.0 of MFractor for Visual Studio Mac.

Generate views, classes and value converters in only a few clicks...\n\nJust right click on that little yellow squiggle and use the fix to generate a whole lotta code.\n\nThere are also more xaml code checks to watch out for nasty Xaml issues and bug fixes galore.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n##Features\n\n - **New code generation actions:**\n    - Generate classes from ` my_namespace:MyMissingClass ` in xaml.\n    - Generate views from ` my_namespace:MyMissingView ` in xaml.\n    - Generate value converters when a missing xaml node ends with \"[cC]onverter] in xaml.\n - **New Xaml analysers:**\n    - For generics, validate that an x:TypeArguments attribute or xml node setter exists.\n    - For generics, validate that the count of parameters provided to x:TypeArguments matches the generics signature.\n    - Validate the root xaml node contains an x:Class directive to set the code behind class name and namespace.\n\n##Enhancements\n\n - This release targets Visual Studio Mac v6.1.1\n\n## Bug Fixes\n\n - Fix a bug in xaml namespace resolution that prevented the \"import new xmlns\" fix from triggering.\n - Allow importing of xaml namespaces from x:Static symbols.\n - For Setters, don't validate TargetType property that the provided type is a static member of System.Type.\n - When a symbol name matches but its in the wrong namespace, don't suggest it as a fix.\n - Remove the MFractor settings panel to fix the Visual Studio Mac preferences dialog from not opening when it didn't exist.\n - When using native view declaration, the xaml symbolicator will now honor the targetPlatform flag and find the assembly for that platform. Previously this was a naive search that used the first assembly found; using the wrong symbols if a assembly of the same name existed in both an iOS and Android project.\n\n\n ##Release Notes - v2.5.3\n\n **10th of October 2016**\n\n **[Download MFractor 2.5.0](http://addins.mfractor.com/releases/2.06.00/MFractor.MFractor_2.06.00.mpack)**\n\n ##Introduction\n\n This is a summary of the changes introduced in v2.5.3 of MFractor for Visual Studio Mac.\n\n This release adds support for native view declaration and property generation for missing view attributes.\n\n ##Features\n\n  - Generate properties and bindable properties onto classes that implement Xamarin.Forms.ObservableObject.\n  - Full support for native view declaration. Tooltips, go-to declaration, xaml analysis and code generation enabled on native views used in Xaml.\n\n ##Bug Fixes\n\n  - Xaml expressions now parsed on attributes that cannot be resolved to a .NET symbol. This enables Tooltips, go-to declaration, xaml analysis and code generation.\n  - The analysis engine no longer assumes that the Xamarin.Forms and Microsoft schemas are the implicit and 'x' namespaces. This means that Xamarin.Forms could be remapped to xmlns:xf etc and the xaml analyser will still function correctly.",
