Likewise, we've done the same with the \n$name$\n argument.\n\n\nIf the new property was a \nstring\n with the name \nMessage\n, MFractor would subsitute each occurance of \n$type$\n with \nstring\n and each occurance of \n$name$\n with \nMessage\n like so:\n\n\nprivate string _Message;\npublic string Message\n{\n    get\n    {\n        return _Message;\n    }\n    set\n    {\n        _Message = value;\n        NotifyPropertyChanged(nameof(Message));\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nWhen possible, MFractor's internal code generators use a code snippet to create code. These code snippets are exposed as configurable properties and are named \nSnippet\n.\n\n\nTo identify what you can\n\n\nWe can customise MFractor by providing code snippets through two sources: \nVisual Studio for Macs snippets\n and \ncode snippets included within your project\n.\n\n\nUsing Visual Studio Macs Code Snippets\n\n\nTo enable MFractor to use a code snippet from Visual Studio Mac, we need to create a code snippet inside Visual Studio Mac and then link it up through an MFractor config file.\n\n\nIn the top menu bar, click on \nVisual Studio\n and then \nPreferences\n:\n\n\n\n\nIn the preferences window that opens, browse to \nCode Snippets...\n and then select \nAdd\n:\n\n\n\n\nThis will open the \nNew template\n wizard.

            "text": "Configuring A Binding Context\n\n\nPower the refactoring engine and xaml analyser by targeting a binding context\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nIn Mvvm architected applications, views use a \nBinding Context\n to display and transfer data between the application logic layer and the view layer with minimal dependencies. This is accomplished through \ndata binding\n; properties on a view are bound to properties on a backing object through binding mechanisms allowing two-way data transfer between the UI and application logic. For a full tutorial on Mvvm architecture, please Microsofts \nThe Mvvm Pattern\n article.\n\n\nWhen working with Xaml, we can specify a binding context to activate binding expression analysis and a variety of BindingContext specific refactorings.\n\n\nWe can specify a binding context \nexplicitly\n via in inline Xaml expression or \nimplicitly\n through the use of common MVVM naming conventions.\n\n\nImplicit Binding Context Resolution\n\n\nMFractor will attempt to infer the relationship between your view models and xaml views via \nimplicit binding context resolution\n. This is done by looking for classes and Xaml views that share a common naming convention.\n\n\nLet's consider the following files:\n\n\n\n\nLoginPage.xaml\n - The xaml view.\n\n\nLoginPage.xaml.cs\n - The code behind for the xaml view.\n\n\nLoginViewModel\n - The a C# class that is the view model for the LoginPage view.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause these pages share the prefix \nLogin\n and each has a distinct file extension or suffix, MFractor assumes the following relationships:\n\n\n\n\nThe \n.xaml\n extension denotes that \nLoginPage.xaml\n is a xaml view.\n\n\nThe \n.xaml.cs\n extension and the \nLoginPage\n component denotes that \nLoginPage.xaml.cs\n is the code behind implementation \nLoginPage\n view.\n\n\nThe \nViewModel\n suffix implies that \nLoginViewModel\n is a view model. When \nViewModel\n is removed from \nLoginViewModel\n and \nPage\n is removed from \nLoginPage\n, the \nLogin\n component implies that the \nLoginViewModel\n is related to the \nLoginPage\n xaml view and it's code behind file.\n\n\n\n\nMFractor uses these common naming conventions of Page.xaml, Page.xaml.cs and ViewModel to decide that \nLoginViewModel\n will probably be the BindingContext for \nLoginPage\n. The \nPage\n \n-\n \nViewModel\n naming convention is used by several popular MVVM frameworks such as Prism and FreshMVVM.\n\n\nThe following suffixes are supported for Xaml views:\n\n\n\n\nPage\n: EG LoginPage.xaml \n-\n LoginViewModel\n\n\nView\n: EG LoginView.xaml \n-\n LoginViewModel\n\n\n\n\nExplicit Binding Context Resolution\n\n\nIn Xamarin.Forms, all views have the property \nBindingContext\n; this specifies the object that a view should data-bind with. When coding with Xaml, we can use the \nx:Static\n markup extension to reference a static C# property and explicitly provide an instance of a C# class as the binding context:\n\n\n \nEntry BindingContext=\n{x:Static local:MyStaticClass.MyStaticProperty}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is known as the \nView Model Locator Pattern\n. We implement a static class named \nViewModelLocator\n and use a static, readonly property to return an instance of the object we want our Xaml view to data-bind with. Historically the \nView Model Locator Pattern\n has been used to provide design time data to the Xamarin.Forms Xaml previewer. For a deeper insight into this pattern, read James Montemagnos excellent \nView Model Locator\n article.\n\n\nFor example, given a Xaml page named \nLoginPage\n, we can explicitly provide an instance of \nLoginViewModel\n as the binding context like so:\n\n\nViewModelLocator.cs\n\n\npublic namespace MyApp\n{\n  public static class ViewModelLocator\n  {\n      public static readonly LoginViewModel LoginViewModel = new LoginViewModel();\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nLoginPage.xaml\n\n\nContentPage\n  xmlns:local=\nclr-namespace:MyApp;assembly=MyApp\n\n  BindingContext=\n{x:Static local:ViewModelLocator.LoginViewModel}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen MFractor begins analysis on LoginPage.xaml it will check if any \nBindingContext\n properties have been assigned to. As the root \nContentPage\n assigns a binding context, it will inspect the value component of the \nBindingContext\n attribute, check if it is a Xaml expression and then evaluate it for the return type.\n\n\nFor the \n{x:Static local:ViewModelLocator.LoginViewModel}\n expression, MFractor will resolve the \nViewModelLocator\n class in the \nlocal\n namespace and then grab the C# type of the \nLoginViewModel\n property. This informs MFractor that the page will be bound to a \nLoginViewModel\n instance and therefore to analyse all \nBinding\n expressions against the \nLoginViewModel\n type.\n\n\nExplicit binding context resolution will also work when referencing another element using \nx:Reference\n expressions. For example, we can bind the on/off state of a switch to the visibility of a text label like so:\n\n\n  \nSwitch x:Name=\nmySwitch\n /\n\n  \nLabel BindingContext=\n{x:Reference mySwitch}\n IsVisible=\n{Binding IsToggled}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen MFractor analyses the \n{Binding IsToggled}\n expression, it will evaluate the \n{x:Reference mySwitch}\n expression and use the type of mySwitch as the BindingContext (Xamarin.Forms.Switch).\n\n\nExplicit binding context resolution will \nalways\n override implicit binding context resolution. If your xaml views are named using the conventions listed above but your page or a view explicitly assigns the \nBindingContext\n property then MFractor will use the \nBindingContext\n return type instead of the implicit Mvvm relationship.\n\n\nData Template Binding Context Resolution\n\n\nData templates are used to provide a nested Xaml view to a view that displays many occurances of that view. For example, a ListView uses a \nDataTemplate\n to specify the view appearance of each instance provided through the \nItemsSource\n property.\n\n\nMFractor will attempt to infer the BindingContext for a data templates view by resolving the \nItemsSource\n property on the wrapping view.\n\n\nConsider the following code:\n\n\n  \nListView ItemsSource=\n{Binding Contacts}\n\n      \nListView.ItemTemplate\n\n        \nDataTemplate\n\n          \nTextCell Text=\n{Binding DisplayName}\n /\n\n        \n/DataTemplate\n\n      \n/ListView.ItemTemplate\n\n  \n/ListView\n\n\n\n\n\nThe inner \nDataTemplate\n has a \nTextCell\n where the \nText\n property is provided by the binding expression \n{Binding DisplayName}\n.

For a full tutorial on Mvvm architecture, please Microsofts  The Mvvm Pattern  article.

This is done by looking for classes and Xaml views that share a common naming convention.  Let's consider the following files:   LoginPage.xaml  - The xaml view.  LoginPage.xaml.cs  - The code behind for the xaml view.  LoginViewModel  - The a C# class that is the view model for the LoginPage view.    Because these pages share the prefix  Login  and each has a distinct file extension or suffix, MFractor assumes the following relationships:   The  .xaml  extension denotes that  LoginPage.xaml  is a xaml view.  The  .xaml.cs  extension and the  LoginPage  component denotes that  LoginPage.xaml.cs  is the code behind implementation  LoginPage  view.  The  ViewModel  suffix implies that  LoginViewModel  is a view model. When  ViewModel  is removed from  LoginViewModel  and  Page  is removed from  LoginPage , the  Login  component implies that the  LoginViewModel  is related to the  LoginPage  xaml view and it's code behind file.   MFractor uses these common naming conventions of Page.xaml, Page.xaml.cs and ViewModel to decide that  LoginViewModel  will probably be the BindingContext for  LoginPage . The  Page   -   ViewModel  naming convention is used by several popular MVVM frameworks such as Prism and FreshMVVM.  The following suffixes are supported for Xaml views:   Page : EG LoginPage.xaml  -  LoginViewModel  View : EG LoginView.xaml  -  LoginViewModel",

            "text": "In Xamarin.Forms, all views have the property  BindingContext ; this specifies the object that a view should data-bind with. When coding with Xaml, we can use the  x:Static  markup extension to reference a static C# property and explicitly provide an instance of a C# class as the binding context:    Entry BindingContext= {x:Static local:MyStaticClass.MyStaticProperty} /   This is known as the  View Model Locator Pattern . We implement a static class named  ViewModelLocator  and use a static, readonly property to return an instance of the object we want our Xaml view to data-bind with. Historically the  View Model Locator Pattern  has been used to provide design time data to the Xamarin.Forms Xaml previewer. For a deeper insight into this pattern, read James Montemagnos excellent  View Model Locator  article.  For example, given a Xaml page named  LoginPage , we can explicitly provide an instance of  LoginViewModel  as the binding context like so:  ViewModelLocator.cs  public namespace MyApp\n{\n  public static class ViewModelLocator\n  {\n      public static readonly LoginViewModel LoginViewModel = new LoginViewModel();\n  }\n}  LoginPage.xaml  ContentPage\n  xmlns:local= clr-namespace:MyApp;assembly=MyApp \n  BindingContext= {x:Static local:ViewModelLocator.LoginViewModel} /   When MFractor begins analysis on LoginPage.xaml it will check if any  BindingContext  properties have been assigned to. As the root  ContentPage  assigns a binding context, it will inspect the value component of the  BindingContext  attribute, check if it is a Xaml expression and then evaluate it for the return type.  For the  {x:Static local:ViewModelLocator.LoginViewModel}  expression, MFractor will resolve the  ViewModelLocator  class in the  local  namespace and then grab the C# type of the  LoginViewModel  property. This informs MFractor that the page will be bound to a  LoginViewModel  instance and therefore to analyse all  Binding  expressions against the  LoginViewModel  type.  Explicit binding context resolution will also work when referencing another element using  x:Reference  expressions. For example, we can bind the on/off state of a switch to the visibility of a text label like so:     Switch x:Name= mySwitch  / \n   Label BindingContext= {x:Reference mySwitch}  IsVisible= {Binding IsToggled} /   When MFractor analyses the  {Binding IsToggled}  expression, it will evaluate the  {x:Reference mySwitch}  expression and use the type of mySwitch as the BindingContext (Xamarin.Forms.Switch).  Explicit binding context resolution will  always  override implicit binding context resolution. If your xaml views are named using the conventions listed above but your page or a view explicitly assigns the  BindingContext  property then MFractor will use the  BindingContext  return type instead of the implicit Mvvm relationship.",

For example, a ListView uses a  DataTemplate  to specify the view appearance of each instance provided through the  ItemsSource  property.

This shortcut collects \nall\n missing binding expressions (excluding bindings inside DataTemplates) and generates them in bulk onto the binding context.\n\n\nWe can access this short cut by right clicking anywhere in a Xaml file, navigating to \nGenerate\n and then selecting the \nImplement View Model\n action:\n\n\n\n\nYou'll notice that there are 2 actions:\n\n\n\n\nImplement View Model\n gathers all missing bindings in the xaml document and implements them all as public properties with a public \nget\n and \nset\n accessor.\n\n\nImplement View Model (Use Backing Fields)\n gathers all missing bindings in the xaml document and implements them all as public properties with a public \nget\n and \nset\n accessor that sets or gets a backing field.\n\n\n\n\nThere are often cases when a binding context isn't specified \nexplicitly \n and can't be inferred \nimplicitly\n. A common example of this is that you have just started to build a Xaml view and haven't yet got around to building the corresponding view model.\n\n\nThe \nImplement View Model\n action can also generate a view model class for the Xaml view if one is not already defined. Using Mvvm naming conventions, MFractor generates a view model class for your xaml view under the \nMyDefaultNamespace.ViewModels\n namespace.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\nLoginPage.xaml.cs\n\n\nEntry Text=\n{Binding Username}\n/\n\n\nEntry Text=\n{Binding Password}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen creating the view model class, MFractor removes the \nPage\n or \nView\n suffix from the view name and then attaches \nViewModel\n to the end of the resulting name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove the \nPage\n or \nView\n suffix: LoginPage -\n Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttach the \nViewModel\n suffix: Login -\n LoginViewModel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerate a new class named \nLoginViewModel\n under the namespace \nMyDefaultNamespace.ViewModels\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis would result in the following view model class file:\n\n\nLoginViewModel.cs\n\n\npublic namespace MyDefaultNamespace.ViewModels\n{\n  public class LoginViewModel\n  {\n    public string Username { get; set; }\n    public string Password { get; set; }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nIf you project references Fody's \nImplementPropertyChanged\n extension, the default getter / setter implementation will also annotate the result with the \n[ImplementPropertyChanged.PropertyChanged]\n attribute:\n\n\nLoginViewModel.cs\n\n\n[ImplementPropertyChanged.PropertyChanged]\npublic class LoginViewModel\n{\n}\n\n\n\n\nGenerating Commands Implementations\n\n\nWhen MFractor encounters a property that expects the \nSystem.Windows.Input.ICommand\n interface, it will generate a property returning a empty command implementation.\n\n\nFor example, we bind our login button to a \nLoginCommand\n property on our view model:\n\n\nButton Command=\n{Binding LoginCommand}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen MFractor generates the property for \nLoginCommand\n, it creates an empty command implementation:\n\n\npublic System.Windows.Input.ICommand LoginCommand\n{\n    get\n    {\n        return new Xamarin.Forms.Command(() =\n\n        {\n            throw new NotImplementedException();\n        }\n\n        );\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nBinding Generation And Value Converters\n\n\nWhen a binding expression uses a \nConverter\n, MFractor will attempt to resolve the input type of the referenced value converter and use that as the property type. We must have a value conversion attribute on the \nIValueConverter\n for MFractor to resolve the input type. Please read the \nValue Conversion Type-Safety\n tutorial to learn more.\n\n\nFor example, we add a login button that is only enabled when the user has their password entered:\n\n\nResourceDictionary\n\n    \nlocal:StringToBoolConverter x:Key=\nstringToBoolConverter\n /\n\n\n/ResourceDictionary\n\n\n\nButton IsEnabled=\n{Binding Password, Converter={StaticResource stringToBoolConverter}}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nProvided that \nstringToBoolConverter\n is annotated to accept string inputs and return a boolean output, MFractor can still generate \nPassword\n as a string even though \nIsEnabled\n is a boolean property.\n\n\nIf there is no value conversion information on the value converter, MFractor will default to \nSysten.Object\n as the type for our property:\n\n\npublic System.Object Password\n{\n  get; set;\n}\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nBy building our apps using the \nXaml first\n mindset, we can leverage MFractor's binding generation to implement our view models quickly.\n\n\nIn this tutorial we learnt:\n\n\n\n\nWe can generate entire view models using the \nImplement View Model\n refactoring action.\n\n\nWe can generate single properties using code issue fixing.\n\n\nWe need a binding context to activate binding expression analysis and issue fixing.\n\n\nWhen a binding uses a value converter, MFractor use the correct type when the converter has a value conversion attribute.",

But what if we had a screen with an email entry that needs to change color when the user enters a valid email?\n\n\nEnter the \nIValueConverter interface\n; value converters transform one data type to another.\n\n\nWe can expose a boolean \nIsEmailValid\n on our binding context, bind the \nTextColor\n field of the entry to the \nIsEmailValid\n property and use an \nIValueConverter\n that converts a \nTrue\n value to black and a \nFalse\n value to red.\n\n\nOur converter would look like this:\n\n\npublic class BoolToTextColorConverter : IValueConverter\n{\n    public object Convert(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)\n    {\n        return (bool)value ? Color.Black : Color.Red;\n    }\n\n    public object ConvertBack(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)\n    {\n        throw new NotImplementedException();\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nAnd when used in our xaml:\n\n\nLoginPage.xaml\n\n\n?xml version=\n1.0\n encoding=\nUTF-8\n?\n\n\nContentPage\n        xmlns=\nhttp://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms\n\n        xmlns:x=\nhttp://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml\n\n        x:Class=\nMyApp.LoginPage\n\n        xmlns:converters=\nclr-namespace:MyApp.Converters;assembly=MyApp\n\n    \nContentPage.Resources\n\n        \nResourceDictionary\n\n            \nconverters:BoolToTextColorConverter x:Key=\nboolToTextColorConverter\n /\n\n        \n/ResourceDictionary\n\n    \n/ContentPage.Resources\n\n    \nEntry TextColor=\n{Binding IsEmailValid, Converter={StaticResource boolToTextColorConverter}}\n/\n\n\n/ContentPage\n\n\n\n\n\nNow when the user enters an invalid email, the value converter will translate the \nIsEmailValid\n boolean property in a \nXamarin.Forms.Color\n!\n\n\nBut what if we accidentally provided a \nstring\n to the \nBoolToTextColorConverter\n:\n\n\nEntry TextColor=\n{Binding Email, Converter={StaticResource boolToTextColorConverter}}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nThis creates a runtime bug we won't discover until we build, deploy and navigate to the \nLoginPage\n; we'll see a type cast exception without a clear indication of the problem.\n\n\nWe can completely avoid this problem by declaring a value converters intent with an \nValueConversionAttribute\n to hint to MFractor's Xaml analyser it's expected behaviour.\n\n\nThe ValueConversion Attribute\n\n\nIn WPF, Microsoft provides the \nValueConversionAttribute\n that developers can use to describe the input, output and parameter type that an \nIValueConverter\n expects. This class level annotation declares the intent of a value converter to tools and to other developers using a converter.\n\n\nUnfortunately this attribute is in the \nPresentationFramework\n assembly, which we can't reference in a Xamarin.Forms PCL or shared project.\n\n\nAs the \nValueConversionAttribute\n is simple in implementation, we can easily make our own:\n\n\n[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Class, AllowMultiple = true)]\npublic class ValueConversionAttribute : Attribute\n{\n  public ValueConversionAttribute(Type input, Type output)\n  {\n  }\n\n  public Type ParameterType { get; set; }\n}\n\n\n\n\nLet's examine this attribute in detail:\n\n\n\n\nThe constructor \nValueConversionAttribute(Type input, Type output)\n declares the expected input and output types for a converter.\n\n\nType input\n is the expected \ninput\n type for the value converter. This is the argument \nobject value\n for the \nConvert\n method and the return type for the \nConvertBack\n method.\n\n\nType output\n is the expected \noutput\n type for the value converter. This is the return type for the \nConvert\n method and the argument \nobject value\n for the \nConvertBack\n method.\n\n\nThe property \nType ParameterType\n is the expected \nparamter\n type for the value converter. This is the argument \nobject parameter\n for the \nConvert\n and \nConvertBack\n methods.\n\n\n\n\nTo use the \nValueConversionAttribute\n in our source code, we annotate a value converter at the class level and use the \ntypeof\n operator to provide input, output and parameter types:\n\n\n[ValueConversion(typeof(bool), typeof(Xamarin.Forms.Color))]\npublic class BoolToTextColorConverter : IValueConverter\n{\n    public object Convert(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)\n    {\n        return (bool)value ? Color.Black : Color.Red;\n    }\n\n    public object ConvertBack(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)\n    {\n        throw new NotImplementedException();\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe \nBoolToTextColorConverter\n now declares it's intent when converting values to both tooling and other developers; it \nmust\n have a \nbool\n as an input and it \nmust\n return into a \nXamarin.Forms.Color\n type.\n\n\nTo include the \nValueConversionAttribute\n we can simply copy-paste the code into our code base. Alternatively, add a third party library like \nFormsCommunityToolkit.Converters\n that has the \nValueConversionAttribute\n defined.\n\n\nConverter Type-Safety in Xaml\n\n\nWhen an \nIValueConverter\n is annotated with the \nValueConversion\n attribute, we declare to MFractor that our value converter wishes to enforce \ntype safety\n.\n\n\nThis has a few benefits:\n\n\n\n\nMFractor can now verify the types passed into and returned by a \nConverter\n expression are correct in the given context.\n\n\nWhen MFractor is generating a property from a binding expression, it can now extract the type information for a converter and generate that property with the correct type information.\n\n\n\n\nLet's consider our previous example of a provided a string as the input to the \nBoolToTextColorConverter\n:\n\n\nEntry TextColor=\n{Binding Email, Converter={StaticResource boolToTextColorConverter}}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen analysing the \nBinding\n expression, MFractor will inspect for \nConverter\n expressions and then evaluate the inner converter for it's expected input and output type.\n\n\nAs we have provided a \nstring\n but \nBoolToTextColorConverter\n expects a \nbool\n, MFractor will mark this as an error within the Xaml editor:\n\n\n\n\nVoila! We now have type-safety in our Xaml when using value converters! \u2728\u2728\n\n\nAnnotated value converters also allow the refactoring engine to correctly generate properties.\n\n\nFor example, if the our binding context is missing the \nEmail\n property, MFractor will extract the input type from the value converter and use that to generate the binding property:\n\n\n\n\nInstead of using the type of the \nTextColor\n property, MFractor could see that \nBoolToTextColorConverter\n expected a \nbool\n value and then generated the \nEmail\n property with a \nbool\n.\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nIn this tutorial we learnt:\n\n\n\n\nWe can annotate implementations of \nIValueConverter\n with a \nValueConversionAttribute\n to declare it's value conversion intent.\n\n\nAnnotated value converters enable MFractor's Xaml analyser to provide type-safety in the Xaml editor.\n\n\nAnnotated value converters enable MFractor's refactoring engine to generate properties with the correct type information.",

ContentPage\n        xmlns= http://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms \n        xmlns:x= http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml \n        x:Class= MyApp.LoginPage \n        xmlns:converters= clr-namespace:MyApp.Converters;assembly=MyApp \n     ContentPage.Resources \n         ResourceDictionary \n             converters:BoolToTextColorConverter x:Key= boolToTextColorConverter  / \n         /ResourceDictionary \n     /ContentPage.Resources \n     Entry TextColor= {Binding IsEmailValid, Converter={StaticResource boolToTextColorConverter}} /  /ContentPage   Now when the user enters an invalid email, the value converter will translate the  IsEmailValid  boolean property in a  Xamarin.Forms.Color !  But what if we accidentally provided a  string  to the  BoolToTextColorConverter :  Entry TextColor= {Binding Email, Converter={StaticResource boolToTextColorConverter}} /   This creates a runtime bug we won't discover until we build, deploy and navigate to the  LoginPage ; we'll see a type cast exception without a clear indication of the problem.  We can completely avoid this problem by declaring a value converters intent with an  ValueConversionAttribute  to hint to MFractor's Xaml analyser it's expected behaviour.",

            "text": "In WPF, Microsoft provides the  ValueConversionAttribute  that developers can use to describe the input, output and parameter type that an  IValueConverter  expects. This class level annotation declares the intent of a value converter to tools and to other developers using a converter.  Unfortunately this attribute is in the  PresentationFramework  assembly, which we can't reference in a Xamarin.Forms PCL or shared project.  As the  ValueConversionAttribute  is simple in implementation, we can easily make our own:  [AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Class, AllowMultiple = true)]\npublic class ValueConversionAttribute : Attribute\n{\n  public ValueConversionAttribute(Type input, Type output)\n  {\n  }\n\n  public Type ParameterType { get; set; }\n}  Let's examine this attribute in detail:   The constructor  ValueConversionAttribute(Type input, Type output)  declares the expected input and output types for a converter.  Type input  is the expected  input  type for the value converter. This is the argument  object value  for the  Convert  method and the return type for the  ConvertBack  method.  Type output  is the expected  output  type for the value converter. This is the return type for the  Convert  method and the argument  object value  for the  ConvertBack  method.  The property  Type ParameterType  is the expected  paramter  type for the value converter. This is the argument  object parameter  for the  Convert  and  ConvertBack  methods.   To use the  ValueConversionAttribute  in our source code, we annotate a value converter at the class level and use the  typeof  operator to provide input, output and parameter types:  [ValueConversion(typeof(bool), typeof(Xamarin.Forms.Color))]\npublic class BoolToTextColorConverter : IValueConverter\n{\n    public object Convert(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)\n    {\n        return (bool)value ? Color.Black : Color.Red;\n    }\n\n    public object ConvertBack(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)\n    {\n        throw new NotImplementedException();\n    }\n}  The  BoolToTextColorConverter  now declares it's intent when converting values to both tooling and other developers; it  must  have a  bool  as an input and it  must  return into a  Xamarin.Forms.Color  type.  To include the  ValueConversionAttribute  we can simply copy-paste the code into our code base. Alternatively, add a third party library like  FormsCommunityToolkit.Converters  that has the  ValueConversionAttribute  defined.",

            "text": "When an  IValueConverter  is annotated with the  ValueConversion  attribute, we declare to MFractor that our value converter wishes to enforce  type safety .  This has a few benefits:   MFractor can now verify the types passed into and returned by a  Converter  expression are correct in the given context.  When MFractor is generating a property from a binding expression, it can now extract the type information for a converter and generate that property with the correct type information.   Let's consider our previous example of a provided a string as the input to the  BoolToTextColorConverter :  Entry TextColor= {Binding Email, Converter={StaticResource boolToTextColorConverter}} /   When analysing the  Binding  expression, MFractor will inspect for  Converter  expressions and then evaluate the inner converter for it's expected input and output type.  As we have provided a  string  but  BoolToTextColorConverter  expects a  bool , MFractor will mark this as an error within the Xaml editor:   Voila! We now have type-safety in our Xaml when using value converters! \u2728\u2728  Annotated value converters also allow the refactoring engine to correctly generate properties.  For example, if the our binding context is missing the  Email  property, MFractor will extract the input type from the value converter and use that to generate the binding property:   Instead of using the type of the  TextColor  property, MFractor could see that  BoolToTextColorConverter  expected a  bool  value and then generated the  Email  property with a  bool .",

To include this control into our XAML, we need to add the following code into the root XAML node:\n\n\nxmlns:ffimage=\nclr-namespace:FFImageLoading.Forms;assembly=FFImageLoading.Forms\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's a few issues with this workflow:\n\n\n\n\nRemembering the \nclr-namespace: ... ;assembly= ...\n syntax is hard!\n\n\nRemembering what namespace and assembly a control is in is hard!\n\n\n\n\nTherefore the \nImport Namespace And Assembly For Unresolved XAML Node\n code fix is very useful because it resolves these for you!\n\n\nThe code action will search all assemblies that the project references for classes that match the name of the XAML node.

For example, consider we wanted to use FFImageLoadings  CachedImage  control like so:       ffimage:CachedImage/   This control lives inside the  FFImageLoading.Forms  namespace in the  FFImageLoading.Forms  assembly. To include this control into our XAML, we need to add the following code into the root XAML node:  xmlns:ffimage= clr-namespace:FFImageLoading.Forms;assembly=FFImageLoading.Forms   There's a few issues with this workflow:   Remembering the  clr-namespace: ... ;assembly= ...  syntax is hard!  Remembering what namespace and assembly a control is in is hard!   Therefore the  Import Namespace And Assembly For Unresolved XAML Node  code fix is very useful because it resolves these for you!

            "text": "Professional Only  Configuration Id: com.mfractor.code_actions.xaml.implement_missing_members  When a control uses undefined members/properties in a Xaml view, this refactoring collects all missing properties, attempts to resolve their types and then generates them onto the control/class.  The following  must  be satisfied for this refactoring to trigger:   One or more undefined members/properties must be in use.  The referenced class must exist.  The referenced class must be writeable; aka it must be in the users source code.  When the referenced class derives from  Xamarin.Forms.BindableObject , this refactoring will allow the generation of bindable properties.   Let's examine the following code:  MyCustomSlider.cs  \npublic class MyCustomSlider : Xamarin.Forms.Slider\n{\n}  MyXamlView.xaml   ?xml version= 1.0  encoding= utf-8 ?  ContentPage xmlns= http://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms \n    xmlns:local= clr-namespace:HelloMFractor \n    xmlns:x= http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml \n     local:MyCustomSlider \n        MinRangeColor= {Binding MinColor} \n    x:Class= HelloMFractor.HelloMFractorPage \n        MaxRangeColor= {Binding MaxColor} /  /ContentPage   When  Implement Missing Members  is actioned MFractor can generate the members/properties as plain old properties (EG:  get; set; ) or as a bindable property implementation.  For example, when actioned to generate bindable properties,  MyCustomSlider  would become:  \npublic class MyCustomSlider : Slider\n{\n    public static readonly BindableProperty MaxRangeColorProperty = BindableProperty.Create(nameof(MaxRangeColor), typeof(Color), typeof(HelloMFractor.MyCustomSlider), default(Color));\n    public Color MaxRangeColor\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            return (Xamarin.Forms.Color)GetValue(MaxRangeColorProperty);\n        }\n\n        set\n        {\n            SetValue(MaxRangeColorProperty, value);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static readonly BindableProperty MinRangeColorProperty = BindableProperty.Create(nameof(MinRangeColor), typeof(object), typeof(HelloMFractor.MyCustomSlider), default(Color));\n    public Color MinRangeColor\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            return (Xamarin.Forms.Color)GetValue(MinRangeColorProperty);\n        }\n\n        set\n        {\n            SetValue(MinRangeColorProperty, value);\n        }\n    }\n}",

MFractors IntelliSense has feature parity and injects a lot of MFractors smarts into the XAML editing experience.\n\n\nInitially we've added obvious auto-completions to take the friction out of what you're currently working on; for example, we suggest available properties when creating a style setter based on the styles \nTargetType\n, suggest available images when editing an image source or even suggest available properties for databinding when MFractor can infer the view model.\n\n\nWe've also revamped our free licensing model; previously we had several feature groups as free and allowed up to 5 pro features per day; this licensing model was confusing, hard to communicate and didn't let you fully evaluate what you'd get by upgrading to MFractor Professional.\n\n\nTo simplify our free tier, we now allow unlimited use of all of MFractor's features in 2 XAML files per day. After you've used your 2 documents per day, Visual Studio for Mac will revert back to it's original behaviour. Additionally, all C# refactorings and inspections are still available in only MFractor Professional.\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\n\nXAML IntelliSense:\n\n\nFeature parity with Visual Studio Macs XAML IntelliSense.\n\n\nThe ability to generate property bindings from XAML when MFractor can resolve the ViewModel. This is intentionally deactivated in DataTemplates, ResourceDictionaries and the App.xaml.\n\n\nSuggest all available properties when the view model for a XAML view can be resolved.\n\n\nSuggest FontSizes such as \nMicro\n, \nSmall\n, \nLarge\n etc\n\n\nWhen in a GridUnit element, suggest \nAuto\n and \n*\n.\n\n\nSuggest the \n.Behaviors\n property for VisualElements and suggest available behaviors.\n\n\nSuggest the \n.Effects\n property for VisualElements and suggest available effects.\n\n\nSuggest the \n.Triggers\n property for VisualElements and suggest available triggers.\n\n\nSuggest the \n.GestureRecognizers\n property for Views and suggest available gesture recognisers.\n\n\nSuggest \nStyle\n, \nColor\n, \nString\n, \nDouble\n, \nOnIdiom\n and \nOnPlatform\n inside resource dictionaries.\n\n\nIn \nStyles\n, suggest \nSetters\n and available styleable controls in the \nTargetType\n property.\n\n\nIn \nSetters\n, suggest properties and relevant property values based on the \nTargetType\n of the parent style.\n\n\nIn \nTriggers\n, suggest properties and relevant property values based on the \nTargetType\n.\n\n\nFor colors, you can now open a color picker while coding XAML.\n\n\nFor colors, you now have access to all Xamarin.Forms colors.\n\n\nFor an \nImageSource\n, MFractor will provide available images from Android (drawable/mipmap) and iOS (Resources/image catalogs) projects.\n\n\nFor an \nImageSource\n, you can now open the Image Wizard to quickly import an image into your project.\n\n\nFor \nOnPlatform\n, suggest available platforms inside \nOn\n elements and provide relevant completions based on the \nx:TypeArguments\n.\n\n\nFor \nOnIdiom\n, provide relevant completions based on the \nx:TypeArguments\n.\n\n\nSuggest the \nMergedDictionaries\n property in resource dictionaries.\n\n\nSuggest available resource dictionaries to merge in \nResourceDictionary.MergeWith\n and \nResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries\n properties.\n\n\nFull native view declaration editing support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew MFractor options panel under \nVisual Studio\n -\n \nPreferences\n -\n \nMFractor\n.\n\n\nUse the \nDelete Output Folders\n action to quickly delete the bin and obj folders for a solution or project.\n\n\nNew C# refactoring to simplify a fully qualified type by introducing a using for its namespace (EG: \nSystem.IO.Path\n becomes \nPath\n + \nusing System.IO;\n);\n\n\n\n\nEnhancements\n\n\n\n\nIntelligent prioritisation of XAML completion suggestions.\n\n\nThe amount of information displayed in the XAML tooltips has been reduced as it was a bit too much.\n\n\nUnder settings, you can now turn off automatic code formatting. You should use this if you want to preserve the structure of code snippets when MFractor inserts them into your code.\n\n\nUnder settings, you can set MFractor to prompt you to choose the location to insert code or for MFractor to insert it automatically.\n\n\nIn the image wizard, when you start changing the width or height of the importing image, the \nResize\n checkbox is automatically enabled.\n\n\nThe \n.droidres\n directory that MFractor creates alongside a solution has been renamed to \n.mfractor\n.\n\n\nSignificantly reduced distribution size. We've shaved 30mbs off the final MFractor distribution bundle.\n\n\nNew licensing model of 2 XAML documents per day.\n\n\nWhen generating new code files or code insertions, MFractor will now convert fully qualified types into a using directive to cleanup code that it generates.\n\n\nMFractors C# code actions are now integrated with Visual Studio Macs \nQuick Fix\n menu.\n\n\n\n\nBug Fixes\n\n\n\n\nFixed: The \nFontSize\n analyser would incorrectly report \nDefault\n as an error.\n\n\nFixed: The Generate Interface code action would occasionally include the entire project folder. \ud83d\ude31\n\n\nFixed: The Generate Interface code action now correctly generates out and ref parameters in methods.\n\n\nFixed: The image wizard would occasionally lock Visual Studio due to a threading issue when adding the downsampled images into the project structure.\n\n\nFixed: The missing image analyser would fail when a project had \nno\n images in it.\n\n\nFixed: The missing image analyser now detects image catalogs on iOS.\n\n\n\n\nDeprecations\n\n\n\n\nDeprecated: MFractor no longer inspects XAML view resources to validate only resource dictionaries are used. This is irrelevant with coming StyleSheet support.",

Reduced memory consumption across the entire product.  The following code analysers have been removed:  Detect when an abstract class was used in XAML. This caused false errors.  Detect when the root XAML node has an x:Name declaration; it's likely the developer wants to reference the root element inside an  x:Reference  markup extension.

This action is not available if the attribute value is an expression or the attribute does not have a corresponding bindable property.\n\n\nOrganise Refactorings:\n\n\nThe \nCollapse Xaml Attributes\n refactoring will collapse all xaml attributes onto the same line as the parent xaml node.\n\n\nThe \nExpand Xaml Attributes\n refactoring will expand all xaml attributes onto separate lines.\n\n\nThe \nSort Xaml Attributes\n refactoring will sort the attributes for a xaml node by namespace and name.\n\n\nThe \nExpand Node\n refactoring takes a self-closing xaml node and generate a closing tag for it.\n\n\nThe \nCollapse Node\n refactoring takes a xaml node with no children and a closing tag and removes the closing tag to make the node self-closing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Code Generators\n\n\nRight click on an xaml node that inherits from \nXamarin.Forms.VisualElement\n or \nXamarin.Forms.Application\n and select \nAdd Resource Dictionary\n to generate a resource dictionary for that element.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Xaml Analysers\n\n\nDetect when an \nx:Name\n code-behind field declaration is empty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnhancements\n\n\n\n\nThis release targets Visual Studio Mac v6.1.5\n\n\nThe \nImplement View Model\n refactoring has been moved from the \nRefactor\n menu to \nGenerate\n.\n\n\nHover over a xaml attribute property that's a \nSystem.Drawing.Color\n or a \nXamarin.Forms.Color\n to see the color value inside the tooltip.\n\n\nThe Android SDK meta-data has been removed from MFractor.mpack; you can download and update the sdk meta-data through the \nHelp\n -\n \nMFractor\n -\n \nInstall Android SDK Meta-Data\n menu item.\n\n\n\n\nBug Fixes\n\n\n\n\nCorrectly validate the type provided to x:TypeArguments; there was a bug in the type checking algorithm.\n\n\nDon't allow the 'Simplify' refactoring to run against expressions.\n\n\nFix multiple type conversion checking bugs in the ValueConversion attribute validation.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Notes - v2.7.0\n\n\n8th January 2017\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nThis is a summary of the changes introduced in v2.7.0 of MFractor for Visual Studio Mac.\n\n\nThis release adds the ability implement entire view models, introduces a dozen xaml analysers and fixes many bugs.\n\n\nI recommend taking a moment to read these tutorials:\n\n\n\n\nImplementing View Models\n: Learn implement entire view models using the \nImplement View Model\n refactoring.\n\n\nValue Converter Type Safety\n: Learn to annotate \nIValueConverter\ns with value conversion attributes for \nConverter\n expression type-safety.\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing View Model Generation\n\n\nYou already love being able to generate bindings but I've taken it to the next level this release \ud83d\udcaa\n\n\n\n\nGot a heap of unimplemented bindings? Right click anywhere in your Xaml document and select \nRefactor\n -\n \nImplement View Model\n.\n\n\nMFractor will collect all the missing bindings and then generate a new class with \nall\n of those properties into a namespace named \nMyDefaultNamespace.ViewModels\n.\n\n\nDoes the view model already exist? Then MFractor simply inserts the missing bindings into the existing view model.\n\n\nI think it'll save you enough time during the week that you may just get to Friday beers a few hours early \ud83c\udf7b\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\n\nBy right clicking anywhere in a Xaml document, implement all missing bindings as a new or into an existing view model:\n\n\nImplement view model properties with a getter and setter.\n\n\nImplement view model properties with a backing field.\n\n\nBound properties that return \nICommand\n will have an empty \nXamarin.Forms.Command\n instance generated.\n\n\nWhen MFractor encounters binding expressions that use a \nConverter\n, it inspects the converter for a \nValueConversion\n attribute to deduce the input typed required. If it can't resolve the converter or the converter does not have value conversion information, it will default to using \nSystem.Object\n.\n\n\nWhen implementing a new view model with getter and setters, MFractor will inspect for references to Fody's \nImplementPropertyChanged\n and annotate the new class with it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Xaml Analysers:\n\n\nValidate that elements declared inside a resource dictionary have an x:Key.\n\n\nValidate that elements declared inside a resource dictionary have a unique x:Key value.\n\n\nDetect when an x:TypeArguments is used on a non-generic type and warn of incorrect usage.\n\n\nDetect when a property setter node (\nMyClass.MyProperty/\n) references a non-existent member on the parent class.\n\n\nDetect when a property setter attribute is empty.\n\n\nDetect when an undefined static resource is referenced by a \nStaticResource\n expression.\n\n\nDetect when the value returned by a \nStaticResource\n expression causes a type mismatch.\n\n\nDetect when an unknown type is being provided to a \nx:TypeArguments\n attribute.\n\n\nValidate that \nOnIdiom\n elements return the correct type for the outer property setter.\n\n\nValidate that \nOnPlatform\n elements return the correct type for the outer property setter.\n\n\nDetect when a developer has misused a property setter inside another xaml element. For example, \nOnIdiom.Phone\n doesn't make any sense when wrapped by the outer element \nOnPlatform\n.\n\n\nDetect when an incorrect input type is provided to a \nConverter\n. The value converter must have a \nValueConversion\n attribute for this to trigger.\n\n\nDetect when an incorrect output type is returned by a \nConverter\n expression. The value converter must have a \nValueConversion\n attribute for this to trigger.\n\n\nDetect when multiple occurrences of the same automation ID exists within a Xaml document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Xaml Fixes:\n\n\nGenerate missing resource dictionary keys.\n\n\nAuto-correct misspelt \nStaticResource\n references.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Simplify Refactorings:\n\n\nAttributes that use a static instance to initialize the property (eg \nVerticalOptions=\"LayoutOptions.CentreAndExpand\"\n) can now be simplified to just the instance name (eg \nVerticalOptions=\"CentreAndExpand\"\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnhancements\n\n\n\n\nThis release targets Visual Studio Mac v6.1.3\n\n\nThe \nAbout MFractor\n dialog now contains a button to copy version and IDE information into the clipboard for bug reports.\n\n\nThis release introduces the framework for an Xml and Xaml refactoring engine. Over time, I'll be adding Xml and Xaml refactoring operations to make code cleanup a breeze.\n\n\nAnnotating value converters with a \nValueConversion(typeof(InputType), typeof(OutputType))\n attribute will trigger the conversion information to render into tooltip. See \nFormsCommunityToolkit.Converters\n for examples.\n\n\n\n\nBug Fixes\n\n\n\n\nSometimes the Xaml document analyser would fail to load and bring down the Xaml editor. This has been fixed.\n\n\nThe View \n - \n Code Behind navigation shortcuts would break when an AST parse was in progress. View \n - \n Code Behind shortcuts will now always be active.\n\n\nWhen property setter nodes are used (\nMyClass.MyProperty/\n), the class component is now correctly validated.\n\n\nWhen importing a Xaml namespace, the element is inserted on a newline and formatted to align with other attributes.\n\n\nWhen resolving the binding context for nested DataTemplates, sometimes the binding context resolver would fail on generics or IEnumerables\n\n\nMore resilient Mvvm resolver to drive the 'Go To View Model', 'Go To Xaml View' and 'Go To Code Behind' shortcuts. MFractor will attempt to infer as best possible the associations between those 3 files.\n\n\nSave the project after adding a new file to it.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Notes - v2.6.0\n\n\n31st October 2016\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nThis is a summary of the changes introduced in v2.6.0 of MFractor for Visual Studio Mac.\n\n\nAs a major release, this release adds several code generation capabilities to improve your Xaml workflow. Generate views, classes and value converters in only a few clicks...\n\n\nJust right click on that little yellow squiggle and use the fix to generate a whole lotta code.\n\n\nThere are also more xaml code checks to watch out for nasty Xaml issues and bug fixes galore.\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\n\nNew code generation actions:\n\n\nGenerate classes from \nmy_namespace:MyMissingClass\n in xaml.\n\n\nGenerate views from \nmy_namespace:MyMissingView\n in xaml.\n\n\nGenerate value converters when a missing xaml node ends with \"[cC]onverter] in xaml.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Xaml analysers:\n\n\nFor generics, validate that an x:TypeArguments attribute or xml node setter exists.\n\n\nFor generics, validate that the count of parameters provided to x:TypeArguments matches the generics signature.\n\n\nValidate the root xaml node contains an x:Class directive to set the code behind class name and namespace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnhancements\n\n\n\n\nThis release targets Visual Studio Mac v6.1.1\n\n\n\n\nBug Fixes\n\n\n\n\nFix a bug in xaml namespace resolution that prevented the \"import new xmlns\" fix from triggering.\n\n\nAllow importing of xaml namespaces from x:Static symbols.\n\n\nFor Setters, don't validate TargetType property that the provided type is a static member of System.Type.\n\n\nWhen a symbol name matches but its in the wrong namespace, don't suggest it as a fix.\n\n\nRemove the MFractor settings panel to fix the Visual Studio Mac preferences dialog from not opening when it didn't exist.\n\n\nWhen using native view declaration, the xaml symbolicator will now honor the targetPlatform flag and find the assembly for that platform. Previously this was a naive search that used the first assembly found; using the wrong symbols if a assembly of the same name existed in both an iOS and Android project.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Notes - v2.5.3\n\n\n10th of October 2016\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nThis is a summary of the changes introduced in v2.5.3 of MFractor for Visual Studio Mac.\n\n\nThis release adds support for native view declaration and property generation for missing view attributes.\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\n\nGenerate properties and bindable properties onto classes that implement Xamarin.Forms.ObservableObject.\n\n\nFull support for native view declaration. Tooltips, go-to declaration, xaml analysis and code generation enabled on native views used in Xaml.\n\n\n\n\nBug Fixes\n\n\n\n\nXaml expressions now parsed on attributes that cannot be resolved to a .NET symbol. This enables Tooltips, go-to declaration, xaml analysis and code generation.\n\n\nThe analysis engine no longer assumes that the Xamarin.Forms and Microsoft schemas are the implicit and 'x' namespaces. This means that Xamarin.Forms could be remapped to xmlns:xf etc and the xaml analyser will still function correctly.",
