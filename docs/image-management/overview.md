**Use MFractors image management suite to import, delete, optimise and manage the image assets in your iOS and Android apps**

## Image Management Tool Suite

Working with image assets is one of the most time-consuming parts of Xamarin development and improving all image related workflows is one of MFractor's core focuses.

At a glance, MFractor's image management tool suite is composed of the following features:

### Image Asset Manager

The image asset manager summarises all image assets across your solution from your iOS and Android projects.

As a developer, you gain a birds-eye view of all image assets in your solution and that then allows you to delete, import, search and optimise all images from a centralised location.

### Image Importer

The image importer takes a source image and generates all densities for iOS and Android apps.

### Image Deletion Tool

The image deletion tool removes all densities of an image asset in all mobile projects. As a developer, you can delete all occurances of an asset in one action instead of needing to track down and delete each density independently.

### Image Optimiser

The image optimiser squashes the size of all image assets in your application, reducing the size of those assets by a factor of up to 75% with no visual loss.

To do this, it uses [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) to perform intelligent image compression.
