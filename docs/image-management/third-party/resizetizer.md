## Overview

!!! info "Take SVG's and PNG's and automagically have them resized to all the different resolutions and included in your Xamarin Android, iOS, UWP, and WPF projects!"

ResizetizerNT is an MSBuild task to automatically generate resized image artefacts for Android and iOS from a shared project.

MFractor automatically detects image assets that are defined using the `SharedImage` element in your `.csproj` files and includes them into the image management engine.

This activates MFractors image tool-suite (such as IntelliSense, tooltips, analysis etc) in projects that utilise the `ResizetizerNT` build tasks.
