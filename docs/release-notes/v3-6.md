## Release Notes v3.6.0

**TO BE DECIDED**

## Introduction

This is a summary of the changes introduced in v3.6.0 of MFractor for Visual Studio Mac.

## Features

 * Our new product tip window will now show up once a week and show you something new about MFractor!
 * Debugging:
    * New **Add Watch** shortcut adds the variable under the cursor to the debug watch pad. This appears above the expression evaluator in the right click context menu.
 * Search:
    * All AutomationIDs that are declared in XAML now surface in the global search bar.
 * XAML Analysis:
    * Unused ResourceDictionary resources are greyed out to let you know they aren't in use.

## Enhancements

 * Visual Studio Mac 7.5 Support.
 * XAML IntelliSense:
    * View and layout auto-completion when inside a `ControlTemplate`
    * ViewCell suggestion when inside a `DataTemplate`
    * Suggest `ControlTemplate` and `DataTemplate` when editing resource dictionaries.
    * Suggest compatible StaticResources for property values.
    * Support for code completion inside XAML expressions.
    * When editing an `xmlns`, MFractor suggests all available assemblies and namespaces and generates the clr-namespace import.
    * When inside a style, trigger, or visual state, you can type the property name of the outer `TargetType` and MFractor will generate the full setter element.
    * When inside a `{Binding ...}` expression MFractor will suggest available properties for data-binding.
    * When inside a `{StaticResource ...}` expression MFractor will suggest available static resources.
    * Support for Visual State Management.
    * Suggest available XMLNS's inside x:Static expressions.
    * Support for the OnIdiom and OnPlatform markup extensions.
    * When editing an attribute that accepts an `ImageSource`, you can use the **Select an image asset** IntelliSense action to browse available images and choose the image you wish to use.
    * Support for FlexLayouts.
 * Static resource tooltips.
 * The image wizard now has an option to skip generating the MSBuild into the projects the new images are placed into. This option can be used for SDK style projects or image assets that are included with wildcards.
 * We've separated out long code snippets into their own pages to make our documentation easier to browse.

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed: Syntax reduction does not work on `new` statements.
* Fixed: `.mfc.xml` files aren't picked up when using nuget package references in SDK style projects.
* Fixed: For manually issued trial licenses, MFractor failed to activate the Professional feature-set.
* Fixed: Using OnPlatform or OnIdiom property setters inside a `<ContentView.Content>` does not suggest available controls.
* Fixed: In Visual Studio Mac 7.5, generating C# code from would cause the C# file to reload and the changes to be lost.
* Fixed: In Visual Studio Mac 7.5, MFractors C# code actions and analysers were no longer available.
* Fixed: In Visual Studio Mac 7.5, image asset tooltips were broken and did not render.
* Fixed: Remove the x:Class does not exist on root element code analyser as it added no value.
* Fixed: Occasionally MFractor would start suggesting properties for an unclosed type in XAML.
* Fixed: When declaring resources inside `Application.Resources` MFractor failed to index them into the resources database, resulting in many static resource analysis and completion errors. MFractor now correctly indexes these elements.
* Fixed: MFractor failed to deduce the relationship to another resource dictionary when using the `ResourceDictionary.Source` attribute.
