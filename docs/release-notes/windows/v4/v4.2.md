## v4.2.0

**Released on May 12th 2020**

MFractor 4.2 for Visual Studio Windows is a major release that adds support for Visual Studio 16.6, serial key license activation and fixes several bugs in the core product.

**Features**

 * We now support license activation via serial key. When you purchase an MFractor Professional license, you will now receive a serial key instead of a license file.
 * We now offer license recovery from within the product. Head to the top MFractor menu, choose **Recover MFractor Professional License** and then enter your email. If a license is available for that email, you will receive a license recovery email.

 **Issues Fixed:**

  * Fixed: Visual Studio Windows 16.6 support. [#217](https://github.com/mfractor/mfractor-feedback/issues/217)
  * Fixed: MFractor doesn't check for Android Vector Drawable files when validating images. [#219](https://github.com/mfractor/mfractor-feedback/issues/219)
