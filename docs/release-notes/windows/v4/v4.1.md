## v4.1.1

**Released on May 16th 2020**

Service release to fix multiple user reported bugs, adds the ability to disable analysers at a document level, color adornment editing support and moves the scaffolder out of preview.

**Features**

 * The Scaffolder is a file creation wizard that infers your intended file type based on the provided name and file extension plus the context that you are creating that new file in.
 * Disable XAML analysers at the document level using the following syntax: `<!-- [MFractor: Suppress(MF1000)] -->` or `<!-- [MFractor: Suppress(com.mfractor.analysis.xaml.binding_expression_resolves)] -->`. [#202](https://github.com/mfractor/mfractor-feedback/issues/202)
 * The `Move Attribute To Parent` can move a matching attribute from an element into it's parent (EG: `Margin="10"` set on a label inside a stack layout will be removed from the label and then added to the StackLayout).
 * You can now edit a color adornment and launch the color editor. [#199](https://github.com/mfractor/mfractor-feedback/issues/199)
