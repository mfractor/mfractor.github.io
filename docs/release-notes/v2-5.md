##Introduction

This is a summary of the changes introduced in v2.5.3 of MFractor for Xamarin Studio.

This release adds support for native view declaration and property generation for missing view attributes.

##Features

 - Generate properties and bindable properties onto classes that implement Xamarin.Forms.ObservableObject.
 - Full support for native view declaration. Tooltips, go-to declaration, xaml analysis and code generation enabled on native views used in Xaml.

##Bug Fixes

 - Xaml expressions now parsed on attributes that cannot be resolved to a .NET symbol. This enables Tooltips, go-to declaration, xaml analysis and code generation.
 - The analysis engine no longer assumes that the Xamarin.Forms and Microsoft schemas are the implicit and 'x' namespaces. This means that Xamarin.Forms could be remapped to xmlns:xf etc and the xaml analyser will still function correctly.
