## v4.3.0

**Released on August 6th 2020**

MFractor 4.3 is a major release to support Visual Mac 8.7 and includes several new features for tooltips plus lots of bug fixes and overall product improvements.

**Features**

 * **Navigation Tooltip Links**: When MFractor can perform a navigation action for the current element, the new `Navigate To` link will appear in the tooltip.
 * **Code Analysis Help Links**: When a code inspection has a help file available, you can now click on the Help link in the tooltip window to learn more about it.
 * **SVG Tooltips:** Hover over an SVG file reference or SVG path data and MFractor will now show you a preview of that SVG. (Mac Only)
 * **Localisation Tooltips for C# and XAML:** When a property maps to a `.resx` localisation lookup, MFractor will display a summary of all localisations for that key.
 * **DateTime Format Preview Tooltips**: Hover over a data time format string to see a preview of it as DateTime.Now.

 **Issues Fixed:**

  * Fixed: Add support for the `XmlnsDefinition` attribute [#98](https://github.com/mfractor/mfractor-feedback/issues/98)
  * Fixed: The Create new Style code action should trigger the Create New Style window instead of a blank one. [#277](https://github.com/mfractor/mfractor-feedback/issues/277)
  * Fixed: Unable to find Carousel `IndicatorView` (false warning). [#289](https://github.com/mfractor/mfractor-feedback/issues/289)
  * Fixed: The `NavigateToFileSpansWorkUnitHandler` is not implemented (breaks go to custom renderer). [#245](https://github.com/mfractor/mfractor-feedback/issues/245)
  * Fixed: Visual Studio Windows - Manage Image Assets - not populating. [#291](https://github.com/mfractor/mfractor-feedback/issues/291)
  * Fixed: Scaffolder on VS Windows Code Preview and Scaffold list broken. [#284](https://github.com/mfractor/mfractor-feedback/issues/284)

     * When over a localisation expression, show localisation values summary in a tooltip.
     * Go to definition support for localisation expressions.
     * Code action to move a string literal to a RESX file (new or existing).
  * Ongoing performance and memory improvements:
     * Removing (most) usages of `Task.Run` to prevent MFractor generating unnecessary threads.
     * Pre-caching/pre-populating as much state as possible when performing XAML analysis.
     * More use of `Lazy<T>` to defer or avoid the cost of expensive resolution operations.
  * Code output previews for the `Generate Customer Renderers` and `Exclude From Linking` features.
  * XAML Localisation: Removed dependency on deprecated `ILocalise` methodology and moved to `.resx` files methodology. See [Xamarin.Forms String and Image Localization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/app-fundamentals/localization/text?pivots=macos).
