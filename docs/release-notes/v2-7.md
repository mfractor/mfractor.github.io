##Introduction

This is a summary of the changes introduced in v2.7.0 of MFractor for Xamarin Studio.

You already love being able to generate bindings but I've taken it to the next level this release...

**Introducing View Model generation:**

Got a heap of unimplemented bindings? Right click anywhere in your Xaml document and select **Refactor** -> **Implement View Model**.

MFractor will collect all the missing bindings and then generate a new class with **all** of those properties into the "MyDefaultNamespace.ViewModels".

Does the view model already exist? Then MFractor simply inserts the new bindings into the existing view model.

I think it'll save you enough time during the week that you may just get to Friday beers a few hours early 🍻

##Features

 - By right clicking anywhere in a Xaml document, implement all missing bindings as a new or into an existing view model:
 	- Implement view model properties with a getter and setter.
  - Implement view model properties with a backing field.
  - Bound properties that return `ICommand` will have an empty `Xamarin.Forms.Command` instance generated.
 - **New Xaml Analysers:**
 	- Validate that elements declared inside a resource dictionary have an x:Key.
 	- Validate that elements declared inside a resource dictionary have a unique x:Key value.
 	- Detect when an x:TypeArguments is used on a non-generic type and warn of incorrect usage.
 	- Detect when a property setter node (`<MyClass.MyProperty/>`) references a non-existent member on the parent class.
 	- Detect when a property setter attribute is empty.
 	- Detect when an undefined static resource is referenced by a `StaticResource` expression.
 	- Detect when the value returned by a `StaticResource` expression causes a type mismatch.
 	- Detect when an unknown type is being provided to a `x:TypeArguments` attribute.
 	- Validate that `OnIdiom` elements return the correct type for the outer property setter.
 	- Validate that `OnPlatform` elements return the correct type for the outer property setter.
 	- Detect when a developer has misused a property setter inside another xaml element. For example, `OnIdiom.Phone` doesn't make any sense when wrapped by the outer element `OnPlatform`.
  - Detect when an incorrect input type is provided to a `Converter`. The value converter must have a `ValueConversion` attribute for this to trigger.
  - Detect when an incorrect output type is returned by a `Converter` expression. The value converter must have a `ValueConversion` attribute for this to trigger.
  - Detect when multiple occurrences of the same automation ID exists within a Xaml document.
 - **New Xaml Fixes:**
 	- Generate missing resource dictionary keys.
 	- Auto-correct misspelt `StaticResource` references.
 - **New Simplify Refactorings:**
 	- Attributes that use a static instance to initialize the property (eg `VerticalOptions="LayoutOptions.CentreAndExpand"`) can now be simplified to just the instance name (eg `VerticalOptions="CentreAndExpand"`).

##Enhancements

 - The "About MFractor" dialog now contains a button to copy version and IDE information into the clipboard for bug reports.
 - This release introduces the framework for an Xml and Xaml refactoring engine. Over time, I'll be adding Xml and Xaml refactoring operations to make code cleanup a breeze.
 - Annotating value converters with a `ValueConversion(typeof(InputType), typeof(OutputType))` attribute will trigger the conversion information to render into tooltip. See [FormsCommunityToolkit.Converters](https://github.com/FormsCommunityToolkit/Converters) for examples.

##Bug Fixes

 - Sometimes the Xaml document analyser would fail to load and bring down the Xaml editor. This has been fixed.
 - Fixed a bug that caused View < - > Code Behind navigation shortcuts to break when an AST parse was in progress. View < - > Code Behind shortcuts should now always be active.
 - When property setter nodes are used (`<MyClass.MyProperty/>`), the class component is now correctly validated.
 - When importing a Xaml namespace, the element is inserted on a newline and formatted to align with other attributes.
 - When resolving the binding context for nested DataTemplates, sometimes the binding context resolver would fail on generics or IEnumerables
 - More resilient Mvvm resolver to drive the 'Go To View Model', 'Go To Xaml View' and 'Go To Code Behind' shortcuts. MFractor will attempt to infer as best possible the associations between those 3 files.
 - Save the project after adding a new file to it.
