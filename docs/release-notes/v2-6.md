##Introduction

This is a summary of the changes introduced in v2.6.0 of MFractor for Xamarin Studio.

As a major release, this release adds several code generation capabilities to improve your Xaml workflow. Generate views, classes and value converters in only a few clicks...

Just right click on that little yellow squiggle and use the fix to generate a whole lotta code.

There are also more xaml code checks to watch out for nasty Xaml issues and bug fixes galore.

Enjoy!

##Features

 - **New code generation actions:**
 	- Generate classes from `<my_namespace:MyMissingClass>` in xaml.
 	- Generate views from `<my_namespace:MyMissingView>` in xaml.
 	- Generate value converters when a missing xaml node ends with "[cC]onverter] in xaml.
 - **New Xaml analysers:**
 	- For generics, validate that an x:TypeArguments attribute or xml node setter exists.
 	- For generics, validate that the count of parameters provided to x:TypeArguments matches the generics signature.
 	- Validate the root xaml node contains an x:Class directive to set the code behind class name and namespace.

##Enhancements

 - This release targets Xamarin Studio v6.1.1

## Bug Fixes

 - Fix a bug in xaml namespace resolution that prevented the "import new xmlns" fix from triggering.
 - Allow importing of xaml namespaces from x:Static symbols.
 - For Setters, don't validate TargetType property that the provided type is a static member of System.Type.
 - When a symbol name matches but its in the wrong namespace, don't suggest it as a fix.
 - Remove the MFractor settings panel to fix the Xamarin Studio preferences dialog from not opening when it didn't exist.
 - When using native view declaration, the xaml symbolicator will now honor the targetPlatform flag and find the assembly for that platform. Previously this was a naive search that used the first assembly found; using the wrong symbols if a assembly of the same name existed in both an iOS and Android project.
