## About MFractor Professional

*Everything you need to know about the Lite and Professional version of MFractor for Visual Studio Mac*

## MFractor Lite VS MFractor Professional

MFractor comes in both a free (lite) and a paid/premium (Professional) version.

The free version contains most features that are included in MFractor Premium; as a Xamarin developer you will find the free version will still help out your day-to-day Xamarin.Android and Xamarin.Forms development a heck of a lot!

If you would like C# code refactoring support, mobile-specific code diagnostics or wish to tweak the code that MFractor creates then you will need to pay for a MFractor Professional license.
