##Autocorrect class or property

When a c# symbol reference expression does not resolve, this fix applies an auto-corrected suggestion from the class/property.

##Auto-Correct Event Handler Name

Auto-corrects a missing event handler name with a closely named callback from the code behind class.

##Autocorrect Nearly Named Property Binding



##Create x:TypeArguments attribute.

Generates an x:TypeArguments attribute, resolving the potential argument types if possible.

##Encapsulate With Resource Dictionary

When declaring the resources for a page/view, it is common to accidentally put resources directly inside a `MyPage.Resources` rather than wrapping the elements with a `ResourceDictionary` declaration.

**Example:**
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<ContentPage xmlns="http://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms"
	xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml"
	x:Class="HelloMFractor.HelloMFractorPage">
	<ContentPage.Resources>
		<x:String>Hello World!</x:String>
	</ContentPage.Resources>
</ContentPage>
```

In the above example, the declaration `<x:String>Hello World!</x:String>` is declared directly inside the property setter, which will cause a type-mismatch exception at runtime.

When actioned, the **Encapsulate with resource dictionary** fix will wrap elements inside a resources property setter node with a resource dictionary. This would correct the above sample to:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<ContentPage xmlns="http://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms"
	xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml"
	x:Class="HelloMFractor.HelloMFractorPage">
	<ContentPage.Resources>
    <ResourceDictionary>
		  <x:String>Hello World!</x:String>
    </ResourceDictionary>
	</ContentPage.Resources>
</ContentPage>
```


##Generate bindable property on type

This fix generates a bindable property onto the targetted class.

##Generate Binding Expression Property Implement



##Generate class

When a c# symbol reference expression does not resolve, this fix generates an implementation for the missing class.

##Generate class and static member

When a c# symbol reference expression does not resolve, this fix generates a stub class declaration with a default, readonly static member.

##Generate Event Handler

When an event handler Xaml attribute references a method that does not exist on the code behind class, the **Generate Missing Event Handler** code fix will generate a method on the code behind class.

Consider the following code:


**View: LoginPage.xaml**
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<ContentPage xmlns="http://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms"
	xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml"
	x:Class="HelloMFractor.LoginPage">
	<Button Clicked="OnButtonClicked"/>
</ContentPage>
```

**Code Behind: LoginPage.xaml.cs**
```
public partial class LoginPage : ContentPage
{
    public LoginPage()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
    }
}
```

The referenced method `OnButtonClicked` does not exist in the views code behind class, `LoginPage`. The corresponding [analyser](http://docs.mfractor.com/xamarin-forms/tools-in-depth/analysers/#event-handler-exists-in-code-behind-class) will detect this issue and annotate it in your source code.

From here, we can action the code fix to generate a method stub in `LoginPage.xaml.cs`:

##Generate Missing Binding Command Stub

When the symbol referenced inside a binding expression is unresolved, this fix can either apply an auto-correcet or generate a property on elements the BindingContext

##Generate Missing Class

When a Xaml node cannot be resolved, this fix will create a new implementation of that class.

##Generate Missing Value Converter

When a Xaml node cannot be resolved and it ends with '[cC]onverter', this fix will create a new implemenation of IValueConverter.

##Generate Missing View

When a Xaml node cannot be resolved, this fix will create a new implemenation of that class deriving from 'Xamarin.Forms.View'.

##Generate property

Generate a static or constant variable onto the targetted class

##Generate property onto parent type

This fix generates a property with a getter and setter onto the parent type.

##Import namespace and assembly

When the namespace inside c# symbol reference expression can be resolved to a .NET symbol in the project or its references this fix generates an 'xmlns' import statement in the root xaml element.

##Import Namespace And Assembly

When an xaml node can be resolved to a .NET symbol in the project or its references this fix generates an 'xmlns' import statement in the root xaml element.

##Remove unused xmlns declaration

Removes the unused xmlns declaration.

##Remove unused xmlns declaration

Removes the unused xmlns declaration.

##Rename Duplicate Namespace References

Replaces all occurances of a namespace with .

##Replace attribute with closely named member

Looks for members on a C# class that are named closely to an unresolved xml attribute and then suggest near matches.

##Replace Field Or Method Reference With Property

Replaces a field or method symbol within a binding expression with a suggested property name.

##Replace node with auto-corrected match

This fix action replaces a mispelt xaml node that can be resolved in an assembly with its correct .NET symbol name.

##Replace unknown property value with autocorrection

When a xaml element property attempts to reference a static field (for instance LayoutOptions.Center), this fix finds the nearest named member and replaces the incorrect value with an auto-correction.

##Replace with correct attached property name

Replaces an incorrect attached property with an auto-corrected value.

##Replace x:Name with closely named member

Replaces an invalid x:Name reference with a similiarly named x:Name declared in the current document.

##Replace xml namespace with auto-correction

Replaces an xml namespace prefix with the auto-corrected xml namespace.
