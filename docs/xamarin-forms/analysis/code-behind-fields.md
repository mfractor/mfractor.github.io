!!! quote "Code inspections to verify declarations and usages of x:Name defined fields"

## Introduction

In XAML, we can use the `x:Name` directive to declare a code-behind field for the XAML element is applied to.

Consider the following code:

```
<ContentPage>
  <Label x:Name="myLabel" Text="Hello World"/>
</ContentPage>
```

The `Label` element will have a code behind field named `myLabel` generated by the XAML design tools. We can then use this field (`myLabel`) in our code behind class or reference it within the current XAML document via the `x:Reference` expression.

There are various issues that can arise from using the `x:Name` directive and MFractor inspects for many known issues and provides code-fixes to resolve them.

## x:Name Has Invalid Characters

As an `x:Name` directive declares a new code-behind field, it's value must follow [C#'s identifier name restrictions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/identifier-names). If we do not follow these restrictions, our code will not compile.

If we enter an invalid name, MFractor will detect this and add a code error to inform you the `x:Name` value will cause a compilation error:

## Duplicate Code Behind Field Declarations

MFractor will inspect all `x:Name` directives and validate that they are unique within the document. As the `x:Name` directive creates a new code-behind field, duplicate `x:Name`  values will also create duplicate fields with the same name, causing a C# compiler error.

## Empty Code Behind Field Declaration

MFractor will inspect all `x:Name` directives and validate that they have a value; excluding a value from the `x:Name` attribute will generate a compiler error:

## Verify Referenced Code Behind Field Exists

We can use the `x:Reference` expression to retrieve the instance of a code-behind field declared via the `x:Name` directive. This is commonly usedto set `BindingContext` of an element to another control in the visual tree, enabling us to data-bind to a property on that control.

For example:

```
<Switch x:Name="switch" />

<Label BindingContext="{x:Reference switch}"
        IsVisible="{Binding IsToggled}"
        Text="Hello World!"/>
```

In the above example, we are control the visibility of the `Label` through the `IsToggled` property on the `Switch`.

MFractor will inspect usages of the `x:Reference` expression and verify that the referenced element is defined in the current document using `x:Name`:

If the referenced code behind field name closely matches a known `x:Name` value, MFractor will suggest a code fix to autocorrect the typo to this name.
