## Introduction

MFractor includes a code-analysis engine that inspects your XAML code for a wide range of common issues.

## Managing Analysers

MFractors code analysers can be enabled or disabled at the application-level through the product **Preferences**.

To enable or disable a particular code analyser, first, navigate to the top menu bar, find the MFractor tab and then click **Preferences**.

Scroll down to **Code Analysis** and you can search for a specific one or toggle to disable at an application level.

If you'd like to disable at for only a particular document, please see our [Disabling Analysers](disabling-analysers.md) article.

MFractor currently includes 95 analysers.

## Available Code Analysers

| Diagnostic ID | Name | Description
| ---   | ---   | ---
| <label title="com.mfractor.analysis.xaml.duplicate_automation_ids">MF1000</label>| Duplicate AutomationIds| Inspects a Xaml document for occurances of duplicate `AutomationId` declarations.
| <label title="com.mfractor.analysis.xaml.empty_automation_id">MF1001</label>| Empty AutomationId Declaration| Inspects a Xaml document for occurances of duplicate `AutomationId` declarations.
| <label title="com.mfractor.analysis.xaml.code_behind_field_name_has_invalid_characters">MF1002</label>| x:Name Has Invalid Characters| Checks that x:Name expressions define a valid code-behind variable name. A value declared by an x:Name attribute must start with a @, _ or a-Z character followed by underscores or alpha-numeric characters.
| <label title="com.mfractor.analysis.xaml.duplicate_code_behind_field_name">MF1003</label>| Duplicate Code Behind Field Declarations| Checks that the value assigned to an `x:Name` attribute is unique within the scope of the document.
| <label title="com.mfractor.analysis.xaml.empty_code_behind_field_name">MF1004</label>| Empty Code Behind Field Declaration| Inspects occurances of the `x:Name` attribute and validates that a value is assigned; empty `x:Name` expressions generate an empty named code-behind field, causing compilation errors.
