!!! quote "Insert a new row or column and update all indices and spans"

## Introduction

When working with Grids, it is a common workflow to add a new row or column and then update the row/column indices and spans.

MFractor contains these options, right-click on a row and select 'MFractor Code Actions'

- Insert Row Before
- Insert Row After

The same is available for columns

- Insert Column Before
- Insert Column After
