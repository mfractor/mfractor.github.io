!!! quote "Previewing the referenced grid row or columns"

## Introduction

When working with Grids in XAML, we often need to understand the layout behaviour of a row or column.

While we can refer to the row or column definition, MFractor provides tooltips that display the width or height behaviour for a given row or column.

## Grid.Row Tooltips

To view the row information of an element, hover your mouse over the `Grid.Row` attribute on the element.

MFractor will provide a short preview of the layout behaviour of that row.

## Grid.RowSpan Tooltips

To view the details of each row within a row span, hover your cursor over the `Grid.RowSpan` attribute.

MFractor will provide a short preview for each row that the row span covers.

## Grid.Column Tooltips

To view the column information of an element, hover your mouse over the `Grid.Column` attribute on the element.

MFractor will provide a short preview of the layout behaviour of that column.
