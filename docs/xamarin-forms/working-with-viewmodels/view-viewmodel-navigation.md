!!! quote "Navigation shortcuts to switch among the three core components of the MVVM pattern"

## Introduction

The MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) Pattern is one of the most common architectural patterns of a Xamarin.Forms application.

By convention, the MVVM pattern is composed by three files:

* The XAML View file (`.xaml`)
* It's code-behind file (`.xaml.cs`)
* A View Model that will provide the features of the view (a C# class contained on its own `.cs` file).

The first two files are kept together, the later is usually kept on a `ViewModels` folders, where all the View Models are declared. Sometimes this makes hard to navigate between those files.
