## Introduction

When working with strings in C#, it's common to replace string literal with interpolated strings to simplify string concatenation.

To speed this up, MFractor includes the `To Interpolated String` code action that transforms a string literal into an interpolated string.

## Using The Code Action

To use the `Convert To Interpolated String` code action, place the cursor over a string literal and press `Alt+Return` or right click and select `Quick Fix`. In the menu that opens, choose `To Interpolated String`.

MFractor will transform the string literal into an interpolated string, placing a `$` before the string literal.
