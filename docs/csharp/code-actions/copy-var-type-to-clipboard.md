## Introduction

The `var` keyword is a powerful C# langauge element that removes the need to explicitly declare local variable types, improving the readability and maintainability of your code.

However, there are sometimes cases when you need to know the type stored by a `var` in order to reuse it in other parts of your code base.

To solve this problem, MFractor includes the `Copy var type to clipbaord` code action to copy the fully qualifed type stored by a `var` expression to the clipboard..

## Using The Code Action

To use the code action, locate a `var` expression and press `Alt+Return` or right click and select `Quick Fix`. In the menu that opens, choose `Copy type name to clipboard`.
