## Introduction

The _Invert Event Handler_ code action allows you to toggle an event subscription between a `+=` to bind the event and `-=` to unbind the event.

This code action is useful as you can quickly invert an event subscription to generate either the binding or unbinding code.

## Using the Code Action

This code action appears in quick actions menu when the cursor is placed on the `+=` or `-=` operator within an event subscription statement.
