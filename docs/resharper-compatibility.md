!!! quote "Using MFractor alongside ReSharper"

## Introduction

ReSharper is a very popular productivity extension for Visual Studio and it is important that MFractor works smoothly along side it.

This guide covers how to enable MFractor to work alongside ReSharper.

## Enabling MFractor with ReSharper

In a default ReSharper installation, MFractor's code actions will not appear in ReSharpers light-bulb menu.

To ensure ReSharper merges in our code actions, first go to the top **Extensions** menu, then **ReSharper -> Options**.

In the options window, go to **Editor -> Visual Studio Features** and then check **Merge Visual Studio light bulb actions into ReSharper** action indicator.
