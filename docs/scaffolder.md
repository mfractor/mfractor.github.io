## Introduction

This guide provides an overview of the Scaffolder, a powerful file generation wizard included in MFractor.

The Scaffolder is a rethink of the `File -> New` workflow to make it smarter, more efficient and more relevant to the conventions in your project.

What separates the Scaffolder from the standard New File Wizard is:

 * It understands ind
 * It is **context aware**. The Scaffolder considers the conventions established by other files in a folder and project when it.
 * It provides a live-preview of the generated code.

**Please note the Scaffolder is in it's early stages. We would love feedback on improving its UX and requests for new scaffolds.**
