## Introduction

When developing Android apps you often need to copy the Package ID of the app to setup store publishing or platforms like Firebase. The _Copy Android Package ID to Clipboard_ tool allows you to quickly copy the package of any Android project in your solution. To access this command:

* **On macOS**: right-click on the Android project on the _Solution Pad_. Under the `Tools`menu you'll find the `Copy Packaged Id to Clipboard` option.
* **On Windows**: right-click on the Android project on the _Solution Explorer_, the `Copy Package Id to Clipboard` will appear on the second section of the menu.
