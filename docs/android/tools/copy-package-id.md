## Introduction

When developing Android apps you often need to copy the Package ID of the app to setup store publishing or platforms like Firebase. The _Copy Android Package ID to Clipboard_ tool allows you to quickly copy the package of any Android project in your solution. Just right-click the project file under the Solution Explorer/Navigator and access the command under the tools menu:

![](/img/android/copy-package-id.png)

The project Package ID (as defined on the `AndroidManifest.xml` file) will be copied to your clipboard.
