## Importing A Professional License

Download and locate your license file (which ends with the extension `.lic`). When purchasing MFractor Professional, this license file will be provided in an email. In this example, our license file is located on our desktop called `license.lic`.

Open Visual Studio for Mac. If you have not activated MFractor with an email address, close the activation window.

In the main Visual Studio for Mac menu bar, select **MFractor** and then **Licensing**. This will open the licensing window where you can import or remove an MFractor Professional license.

Next, click on the **Import License** button, browse to the license file (`license.lic`) and double click it to import the license into MFractor.

**It is safe to delete the license file from its original location. MFractor stores the license inside itself.**

The licensing window will list:

 * **Licensed To** - The full name of the person that the MFractor Professional license is issued to.
 * **License Email:** - The email that this MFractor Professional license is issued against.
 * **License Type and Expiry Date** - The type of license issued (Professional, Trial or Lite) and when that license expires.

## Deactivating Your Professional License

If you'd like to remove a license from MFractor, you can open the MFractor license information window and click **Remove License**.

**IMPORTANT: This is a destructive operation, you cannot undo removing a license but you can re-import a new license.**

After removing a license, you will be automatically downgraded to a free MFractor license. This allows usage of most features apart from C# code actions, mobile-specific C# code diagnostics, and configuration file support.

## Updating MFractor

MFractor will periodically notify you when an update is available.

You can also check for updates at any time by opening the **Visual Studio Mac** main menu and selecting **Check for Updates...**
